                <h4><em>Folder Structure and URL Scheme:</em></h4>

                <p>I will be honest, I was not sure what was meant by these two things. But after doing some research, I think I have an idea of what these are, and how to 
                <br>approach them.</p>

                <p>Folder Structure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Root folder:
                        <ul>
                        <li>index.html</li>
                        <li>profile.html</li>
                        <li>blogs.html</li>
                        <li>essays.html</li>
                        <li>design.html</li>
                        <li>portfolio.html</li>
                        <li>images folder
                            <ul>
                            <li>will contain any images used in the website</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>styles folder
                            <ul>
                            <li>will contain all .css files used to style the website</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>scripts folder
                            <ul>
                            <li>will contain all javascript files.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I did some research and found a website (Stein, 2019) explaining a simple folder structure, and what the goal of each file is. This made sense to my 
                <br>overly busy brain, so I decided to stick to the basics in this sense. I did not want to over complicate things if it was not necessary.</p>

                <p>URL scheme:</p>

                <p>Again, I was unsure about what this is, but after watching the lecture videos and searching the depths of google, I realised how URL's work in websites, and I 
                <br>think I understand now. What I did was write a URL for every page that would be on my website. I am unsure if this is what was meant by doing a URL 
                <br>structure, but that is what I did:</p>

                <p>index: https://wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io/WSOA3028A_2615283/index.html/</p>

                <p>or  https://wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io/WSOA3028A_2615283</p>

                <p>To me this makes the most sense to use. The user of the website would be able to see where in the website they currently are, and so would I. It makes the 
                <br>most sense to me to have URL's that show your path exactly, in words that are easily understandable.</p>

                <h4><em>Reflecting on the reading:</em></h4>

                <p>So, after reading the first 7 pages (again), I picked up some more info that I did not the first time. It seems to me, that Moulthrop starts by relaying the history 
                <br>of hypertext up until that point.</p>

                <p>He talks about how people thought this might have caused a revolution in information synthesis, but it did not do so, per say. I feel like it was more a quiet 
                <br>thing that emerged over time. But it was a great thing.</p>

                <p>He also talks about how hypertext and hypertext systems could have a large social and political effect. He refers to Nelson, who wanted to create this 
                <br>system and give access to the public, share the knowledge and so. And then, in contrast, he talks about Stoll, who believes that such information should be 
                <br>kept within certain communities, like scientific communities, and later policing (i think it can be called this) communities. But Moulthrop also mentions that 
                <br>this has its downsides, as policing communities use the information databases to access private information.</p>

                <p>He talks about how we have a simple hypertext system now, but it might and most probably will expand over the next years.</p>

                <p>I am aware that the above paragraphs are confusing as all heck, but this is what I got from the first 7 pages, before the McLuhan Law of Media questions 
                <br>that Moulthrop answers.</p>

                <p>To add my two cents, I think that it is important that information (scientific or otherwise) is made available to the normal person. As well as the ability to add 
                <br>our own musings and opinions. It is dangerous yes, but important. We see this today where people are more educated about topic they are interested in, and 
                <br>can become educated on important topics that is relevant to present times. Using the internet will always be dangerous. It is filled with people who spread 
                <br>misinformation or create funky websites with dangerous things on it. This is why we must be careful (in other words, or in the words of Christine wisdom, 
                <br>don't get scammed... it's been a rough week...). However, the internet can be a wonderful place. I know so much about so many different things, important 
                <br>and not important.</p>

                <p>I get the feeling that a lot of the people that are referenced in this reading also forgets that not all people will access all pieces of information. There just is 
                <br>not enough time in the world. Everyone will access the parts that interest them, and yes, some will access the dangerous parts. But I do think in a lot of ways, 
                <br>the internet and hypertext pieces, have more pros then cons.</p>

                <p>Moulthorp then analyses hypertext within the context of McLuhan's Law of media questions:</p>

                <p><em>1. What does it enhance or intensify?</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In short, connections. Hypertext enables users to make connections between things that seem to reference each other. This is very clearly seen with 
                    <br>things like Wikipedia where there are words and names that are blue. If yo click on them, it leads you to a different page with more information on it. The 
                    <br>reading also talks about how this can cause paranoia. I can honestly see this happening. Someone feverishly connecting things that might not even 
                    <br>connect all that well, making it an obsession. It puts me in mind of someone with a wall of images and articles all connected by red string.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>2. What does Hypertext Displace or Render Obsolete?</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>According to this piece, not books. But when I read further, it kind of came accross as if it is replacing books. Or at least printed ones. It is also possibly a 
                    <br>solution to the tv craze. Well, this is what I got from it at least. This is a hard question, because hypertext is definitely making an appearance in literary 
                    <br>works. I have the Assassin's Creed books (by various authors) on my kindle. The books contain various words in Italian, and the kindle enables you to click 
                    <br>on a word that then takes you to the definition at the back of the book. But it is not really replacing the book. I would agree though, that it is reviving 
                    <br>literary work.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>3. What does hypertext retrieve that was previously obsolete?</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With this question the text suggests that hypertext might revive the knowledge and importance of typographic literacy. It makes a lot of the harder to 
                    <br>understand texts easier to understand, as concepts that are hard to understand could be linked to an explanation, or could be linked to another piece 
                    <br>that might help a reader understand better what is going on. This could have a positive or negative effect on political and social aspects of life. In my 
                    <br>personal opinion, the pros outweigh the cons. It makes things accessible, for a wider range of people, and means that more people coiuld be better 
                    <br>educated on more topics.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>4. What does hypertext become when taken to its limit?</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The text suggests that hypertext might create a whole new form of internet interaction that could have social and political implications. This could be a 
                    <br>good thing, but it also says that we should be careful as institutions might not take this lightly. I am unsure what to do with this. To me, this part is just as 
                    <br>it says. Hypertext could be a wonderful thing, but it could have negative implications as well.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I am not sure if I looked at this text correctly at all. It is quyite a complicated text, and a lot of it went over my head, but this was some of my thoughts and 
                <br>findings in the reading.</p>

                <h4><em>Reflecting on interaction and the www:</em></h4>

                <p>The video spoke to my soul. This is a problem I face way too many times in a week, and I am ashamed every time. This made me think a lot about how really 
                <br>thinking about your design, as well as reiterating on a design, getting feedback, and changing things can help your design be a lot better.</p>

                <p>Doors aside, I hope to make my website in such a way that what you can do is intuitive, and not confusing. I do not want people to leave my website feeling 
                <br>more irritated than they were when they pushed a pull door.</p>

                <p>Interaction, or interactivity, to means reactive. When a user does something on a page, there should be a reaction, and there should be some form of 
                <br>feedback. So, when a user presses a button, it changes to a different page, and the button changes colour, or pulses, or something else. In my opinion this 
                <br>makes a website, and honestly most other things, much more pleasant to use.</p>

                

                <p>This blog post, is a little all over the place, and when adding it to my website, I will probably be adjusting it a little. My brain is still trying to process a lot of 
                <br>what was said in the reading and in class.</p>
