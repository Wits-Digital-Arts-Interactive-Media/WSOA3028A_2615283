                    <strong>My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:</strong>
        
                    <p>I had a rather easy time setting up the GitHub, because this I have done before. It is something I make a point of using when I am making games or doing 
                    anything coding related. Publishing to Pages was a little more daunting. The idea that the website I will be making will be out there for people to see as I do 
                    so is terrifying but also exciting. There was an interestingly proud feeling to know that there is a website I 'made' out there, even if it was literally just a page 
                    that said "this is a test". It is scary, but exciting and I cannot describe the excitement I feel for the rest of the semester where we learn to make this website 
                    into something more tangible.</p>    
                        
                    <strong>Reflection on the readings I selected - relating it to my experience with the internet today:</strong>
                    <p>I read a few of the readings, as I find this topic of where the internet came from and where it all started to be extremely interesting. However, the one I 
                    found the most interesting was <cite>As We May Think by Vannevar Bush (1945)</cite>. What he describes is what we are so used to today in the form of the internet. 
                    We have any information we want at the press of a button, we can have more than one piece of information in front of us at the same time, we can make 
                    links between pieces of information, we can record and transcribe information, and we can mass produce information by sending it to someone else. We 
                    have what he was writing about, it just looks a little different from what he envisioned. It is fascinating how something someone thought of more than 80 
                    years ago came to fruition, and is being constantly improved and expanded upon. I have never thought about the internet and the work that went into 
                    getting to where it is today, as much as I have in the past few days as I was thinking about what I read in this reading. We have the privilege of being able to 
                    use what someone else wished and hoped they could.</p>

                    <p>I went to look what else I could find on the Memex, so I could more clearly understand what he was describing and I found a few short videos. The first one 
                    was more of an explanation of what the Memex was and what then lead to the internet afterwards. Something I learned from this is that the Transistor was a 
                    big player in what came after. It is pretty much where electronics started, which I found to be very interesting, I did not know this. I have honestly never been 
                    this curious about how computers were originally made, and I will probably go back and start looking into it further.</p>

                    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8s2jkq-R5o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8s2jkq-R5o</a>
                    
                    <p>Then I watched two videos on how the Memex might have looked and worked according to the intricate explanation that Bush (1945) gave in the article. 
                    The first one is quite quick and it is a bit harder to see what is going on, but I still think it is an interesting watch. The second one is an animation, as well as a 
                    video of how someone interacts with it. It was like an interactive piece that you can find on the internet and interact with like a game or a simulation (in a 
                    quick search, I could not find it, but the video illustrates in quite nicely).</p>

                    <strong>Interesting things I have found about the history of the web:</strong>
                    <p>So, I was not sure how to answer this question as I find the internet to be both fascinating and terrifying (not to mention the people who use it, I mean look 
                    at r/place, which i know is just Reddit users but I feel like a lot of internet users are on Reddit, so I think it can be used as somewhat of an illustration of the 
                    people on the internet). So, I literally looked up 'interesting facts about the internet' and found an article on Bluespan (2016) named <cite><a href = "https://bluespan.com/blog/20-interesting-facts-about-the-internet">'20 Interesting Facts 
                    About The Internet.'</a></cite> There were many interesting things but the one that caught my eye was number 10 "87% of people have not heard the term 'Internet of 
                    Things.'" (Bluespan, 2016). I have, in fact, not heard about this, so the rabbit hole began (Okay, it was not a very deep hole, I found a really good article that 
                    explains what it is, why it is used and where it is used, really well).</p>
                    
                    <p>So, how I understand it, is that the internet of things is a network of things that are all connected and send and receive data to each other and the cloud. 
                    These things usually have certain pieces of technology in them like sensors and software. These things can be a multitude of things from a cellphone, 
                    computer, or car to a heart implant or a biochip. These things share information and act on the information accordingly. It usually does this on its own, 
                    but humans can interact with these devices and the database they are connected to (Gillis, no date).</p>

                    <p>This is just a little bit on the internet of things, but the article and other articles goes into a lot more depth about these things.</p>         
                        
                    <strong>My goals for this course:</strong>
                    <p>My answer might be on the more obvious side. I would like to learn how to build a website and learn more about the internet, as well as learn the different 
                    languages that are being taught. I am very excited about the fact that we are building a portfolio, because for the last few months I have been trying to figure 
                    out how I am going to be doing that. This gives me the opportunity to learn new things as well as make the thing I need and want to make.
                    </p>
