        <article class="Blog-1-Content">
            <h4>My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:</h4>
        
            <p>I had a rather easy time setting up the GitHub, because this I have done before. It is something I make a point of using when I am making games or doing 
            <br>anything coding related. Publishing to Pages was a little more daunting. The idea that the website I will be making will be out there for people to see as I do 
            <br>so is terrifying but also exciting. There was an interestingly proud feeling to know that there is a website I 'made' out there, even if it was literally just a page 
            <br>that said "this is a test". It is scary, but exciting and I cannot describe the excitement I feel for the rest of the semester where we learn to make this website 
            <br>into something more tangible.</p>    
                
            <h4>Reflection on the readings I selected - relating it to my experience with the internet today:</h4>
            <p>I read a few of the readings, as I find this topic of where the internet came from and where it all started to be extremely interesting. However, the one I 
            <br>found the most interesting was As We May Think by Vannevar Bush (1945). What he describes is what we are so used to today in the form of the internet. 
            <br>We have any information we want at the press of a button, we can have more than one piece of information in front of us at the same time, we can make 
            <br>links between pieces of information, we can record and transcribe information, and we can mass produce information by sending it to someone else. We 
            <br>have what he was writing about, it just looks a little different from what he envisioned. It is fascinating how something someone thought of more than 80 
            <br>years ago came to fruition, and is being constantly improved and expanded upon. I have never thought about the internet and the work that went into 
            <br>getting to where it is today, as much as I have in the past few days as I was thinking about what I read in this reading. We have the privilege of being able to 
            <br>use what someone else wished and hoped they could.</p>

            <p>I went to look what else I could find on the Memex, so I could more clearly understand what he was describing and I found a few short videos. The first one 
            <br>was more of an explanation of what the Memex was and what then lead to the internet afterwards. Something I learned from this is that the Transistor was a 
            <br>big player in what came after. It is pretty much where electronics started, which I found to be very interesting, I did not know this. I have honestly never been 
            <br>this curious about how computers were originally made, and I will probably go back and start looking into it further.</p>

            <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8s2jkq-R5o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8s2jkq-R5o</a>
            
            <p>Then I watched two videos on how the Memex might have looked and worked according to the intricate explanation that Bush (1945) gave in the article. 
            <br>The first one is quite quick and it is a bit harder to see what is going on, but I still think it is an interesting watch. The second one is an animation, as well as a 
            <br>video of how someone interacts with it. It was like an interactive piece that you can find on the internet and interact with like a game or a simulation (in a 
            <br>quick search, I could not find it, but the video illustrates in quite nicely).</p>

            <h4>Interesting things I have found about the history of the web:</h4>
            <p>So, I was not sure how to answer this question as I find the internet to be both fascinating and terrifying (not to mention the people who use it, I mean look 
            <br>at r/place, which i know is just Reddit users but I feel like a lot of internet users are on Reddit, so I think it can be used as somewhat of an illustration of the 
            <br>people on the internet). So, I literally looked up 'interesting facts about the internet' and found an article on Bluespan (2016) named '20 Interesting Facts 
            <br>About The Internet.' There were many interesting things but the one that caught my eye was number 10 "87% of people have not heard the term 'Internet of 
            <br>Things.'" (Bluespan, 2016). I have, in fact, not heard about this, so the rabbit hole began (Okay, it was not a very deep hole, I found a really good article that 
            <br>explains what it is, why it is used and where it is used, really well).</p>
            
            <p>So, how I understand it, is that the internet of things is a network of things that are all connected and send and receive data to each other and the cloud. 
            <br>These things usually have certain pieces of technology in them like sensors and software. These things can be a multitude of things from a cellphone, 
            <br>computer, or car to a heart implant or a biochip. These things share information and act on the information accordingly. It usually does this on its own, 
            <br>but humans can interact with these devices and the database they are connected to (Gillis, no date).</p>

            <p>This is just a little bit on the internet of things, but the article and other articles goes into a lot more depth about these things.</p>         
                
            <h4>My goals for this course:</h4>
            <p>My answer might be on the more obvious side. I would like to learn how to build a website and learn more about the internet, as well as learn the different 
            <br>languages that are being taught. I am very excited about the fact that we are building a portfolio, because for the last few months I have been trying to figure 
            <br>out how I am going to be doing that. This gives me the opportunity to learn new things as well as make the thing I need and want to make.
