                <strong>Define and discuss your user alignment, and map out your sites content, experience, and interface elements:</strong>

                <p>User Alignment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>My goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>I want to be able to display the skills I have through the pieces I have made. Whether this be games I made, prototypes I made, assets I made, written pieces or links to other websites I made [This last one will probably only be in the far future].</li>
                    <li>I want to display the game elements I have made, the writing I have done, and any other piece I have made in a sensical way so it is not only displayed for the user to see, but easy to navigate, easy to understand and easy to access.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>User:
                <ul>
                    <li>My target audience is game design companies looking to employ someone new to join their team. This is the career path I hope to follow when I finish this degree, and I think it would be beneficial to start looking at how my portfolio page I will be using when I finish this degree would look like. That portfolio will most likely not be this one, but this is very good practice.</li>
                    <li>They would like to see my skills and experience up until that point in my life, as well as who I am. They would want to find these things easily without getting frustrated by the way they have to navigate the website.</li>
                    <li>They would want to see the pieces I have made and continue to make, as well as how to contact me. My portfolio should be emphasized and should also be dynamic, as things will be consistently added to it as I make new things.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images-in-blogs/Mind Map.png" alt="Mind map showing the connection and importance of the pages on the website." title="Mindmap showing page importance" id="blogImage">

            <p>Above is a mind map showcasing a few different things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The most important page is the Home Page (center):
                <ul>
                    <li>This page will show important highlights from other pages, like the most recent addition to my portfolio, some basic information about myself and my 
                    contact information.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The next page is the portfolio:
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the main content, because this shows my experience, what I have made and possible works in progress.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Then the portfolio:
                <ul>
                    <li>This is information about me, as well as my CV and my contact information.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Then Designs
                <ul>
                    <li>This page will contain my design decisions for the pages.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Then Essays and Blogs:
                <ul>
                    <li>I am not exactly sure which one should go first yet.</li>
                    <li>This will contain all my blog posts as well as my essays.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The arrows on the image above shows how the user will be able to access each of the other pages, no matter what page they are currently on. I want the 
                user to be able to access everything from anywhere, meaning they will not have to back track every time they want to see a different part of the website. 
                I think this makes the website easier to use, and keeps users from being frustrated while using my website.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your structure and URL scheme, and how it relates to semantic markup:</strong>

            <p>This exercise relates back to accessibility. Making the URL structure easy to use means that it is more accessible, and easily accessible. This is the aim of 
            planning out how users might use the website and how things are connected as well. It also relates to the semantic markup in the code, as this makes it 
            easier for people who cannot read easier to access with accessibility aids. Semantic mark up is also important for coders. If you are to work on a website with 
            someone else, it is important that they also know what is going on, and if you were to go back months later, it is important for you to know what is going on.</p>

            <strong>Reflect on your development progress for the week:</strong>

            <p>I did not get as far as I would have liked to, however, I am making progress. I am starting to figure out the semantic markup for my website code. I was quite 
            happy to see that I was already implementing a lot of it as that is the only way I would know what is going on in the code. I am planning to make some big 
            adjustments to the markup as well as the meta in the next week to make the markup even better... and as a result make sure I am hitting the requirements 
            for the assignment submission.</p>
