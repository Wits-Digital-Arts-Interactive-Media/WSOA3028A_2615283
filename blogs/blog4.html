                <li>My Goal:
                    <ul>
                    <li>I want a website that illustrates my skill-set, my experience and be a showcase of the work I have done. I want the users of the website to easily find 
                    what they need about me and easily be able to contact me.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>My User:
                    <ul>
                    <li>For now, the user will be who ever is marking the website. But the user I am keeping in mind is the person who will possibly hire me one day. Anyone 
                    looking for someone with my skill-set to work for them.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>My Content:

                    <li>My portfolio of work that I have done (Important)</li>
                    <li>My experience (Important)</li>
                    <li>Information about me (extra)</li>

                    <strong>Reflect on your work for Website 1:</strong>
                    <strong><em>Where have you struggled?</em></strong>
                    <p>I am and have struggled with some of the more pragmatic decisions. Above I have a basic information structure and user flow, but I am not sure if these are 
                    how I want them to be, or if they are w=effective the way they are now. This is something I want to discuss with a tutor or with Hanli in class, so i can make 
                    some changes before I hand in my first website. i am also not sure how much of this I can implement with the skills I have now, I will have to look into it 
                    further.</p>

                    <strong><em>What are you proud of?</em></strong>
                    <p>I am proud of how quickly I was able to figure out how to do many of the things I wanted to implement in my website to this point. Yes, these are simple 
                    things, but I was really afraid that I was not going to know what goes on most of the time, or that I would struggle a lot more than I initially thought I would. 
                    And do not get me wrong, none of this is easy by any means, but i enjoy it, and I am impressed by how much of it I understand.</p>

                    <strong><em>What do you want to change going forward?</em></strong>
                    <p>The way the website looks right now isn't all that great, and I would like to be able to change that soon, and make it look a bit more like I want it to. There is 
                    still a lot I want to implement and I am not able to do some of it yet, but I am excited to learn how to do so.</p>
