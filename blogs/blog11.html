            <h2>Reflect on the internet as an ethical space. What does that mean to you?</h2>
            <p>This is a hard question, as I do not experience the internet as a very ethical space. I think there are certain spaces on the internet that can be considered ethical, but as it is, I do not think that it is very ethical.</p>
            <p>To me, an ethical internet would be more equal, accessible and kind. Right now, however, I do not think that is what it is. </p>
            <h2>What would this look like?</h2>
            <p>What I wish it looked like, was people being kinder and more considerate of others also using the space. </p>
            <p>The internet is an integral part of our lives. It is consistently reinforcing itself to be a part of the very fabric of our lives, as mentioned by Orgad (2007). We are living on the internet together, and it has become a sort of environment, that we need to work together as a society to keep clean and safe for everyone, not just privileged groups of people. </p>
            <p>When creating in the space, creators must be aware of what they put out and how it might affect others. They must be open to feedback and change to make things better for others.</p>
            <p>Users of the space must be cognisant of the other users there with them, and be aware that what they say on the internet is pretty much forever. It won’t just affect their lives, but it might affect others, and just because you are on the internet, does not mean your actions do not have consequences. </p>
            <p>I would love for the internet to be a safe space, a community of people working together to make it better and more accessible for everyone, but unfortunately, this is not what it looks like. </p>
            <h2>What are the challenges that we face?</h2>
            <p>Except for the challenges that are faced by creators as mentioned in the previous blog, there are many other challenges faced by users of the Internet to make it a safer and better place.</p>
            <p>As Orgad (2007) mentions: “…as in the case with the natural environment, the resources provided by the media environment can be used, misused and refused, distorted and enhanced.”</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, a lot of the time it is grossly misused. I think one of the biggest challenges we will face is the users of the internet. We are all human and make mistakes, and that is one thing. Unfortunately, there will always be people doing things maliciously, which makes the internet a tough place to be.</p>
            <p>Because the internet is often not personal, people don’t always think of how their words and actions affect others, and this means that a lot of people feel unsafe in the internet space.</p>
            <p>Not to mention the fact that there are sites that aim to harm with more than just words (I think most of us have been scammed more than once). </p>
            <p>The internet is a scary place, and I think we have our work cut out for us in trying to make it a better place. </p>
