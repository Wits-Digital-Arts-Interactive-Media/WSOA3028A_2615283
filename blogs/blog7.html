                <strong><cite>Towards a study of information Geographies - Graham, De Sabbata and Zook (2015)</cite>:</strong>
                <em>A summary as I understand the paper:</em>
                <p>This paper speaks about how information has and always had geography. Before the internet, it was more location specific. Only the people that had the instruments and the skills were able to record information. This information was recorded on an immutable mobile, paper, and then stored in books. With the printing press it was made, "... relatively cheap to create and transport information in the container of printed paper while simultaneously limiting how its form could change." (Graham, De Sabbata and Zook, 2015) </p>
                <p>When ICT-based (Infomation and Communications technology) came along, information and power became intertwined. The information available (or not available) about a place, became part of the place and had some form of power over it. As Graham, De Sabbata and Zook (2015) mentions, if a place is not represented on a map or on the internet for people to find, it becomes basically invisible to majority of the population.</p>
                <p>This is one thing if it is a restaurant that does not have a location on Google maps, but it is a completely different and more dangerous situation if the power of information about a place becomes a political tool. It becomes a major issue when a group of people tries to "... impose different narratives on informational augmentations."(Graham, De Sabbata and Zook, 2015). This is especially dangerous when the group of people imposing the narrative is of "more power" than the place they are imposing narratives about. This is something we have seen happen countless times over the past 30 years while the internet was at large.</p>
                <p>A big thing that leads to this problem is the unequal access to internet. This is unfortunately still a large issue, as internet broadband is unattainable for many people in many regions of the world. The reading shows many graphs, but the two I find most interesting is internet users by country (this is a good statistic to look at as an overview of who has access and who is using that access) and the cost of internet relative to the average income in a region (this to me is a large indication of access. If you cannot access the internet, it is quite hard for you to participate, contribute and ultimately change the statistic and make a change in the information that might represent the place you live in incorrectly or unfairly).</p>
                <p>The data showing the internet users by country shows some interesting statistics. The most interesting ones is that in many of the worlds countries that make up majority of the internet users in the world, the internet users in those countries make up a surprisingly small percentage of their total population, indicating that there is still room for growth. The data also shows that almost all of the countries that have more than 80% of their population on the internet are located in Europe. In Africa there was growth in the percentage of people on the internet in North African regions as well as in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. However, many sub-Saharan African countries with very little internet users have seen very little growth. This shows a large need for more access in these countries that are not part of the global North.</p>
                <p>With the data on the cost of broadband relative to the average income, it shows the need in greater detail. Not being able to pay for internet is a big reason why places with a lower average income have so little internet users. Having your internet cost be less than 10% of your income in North and South America and Europe is a far cry from having it be between 10% and 250% in most parts of Africa. This is a hard problem to solve, as it is not necessarily the cost of the internet that is the problem, but the problem lies in the low average income.</p>
                <p>The above two graphs mentioned shows information geography the best. It shows who has access and, thus, who can contribute, create, learn and participate in information, and who cannot.</p>
                <p>The rest of the graphs strengthens the two above named, but I feel these two are definitely the most important, as it gives you a good overview of who can and cannot access the internet and participate.</p>
                
                <strong><cite>How geography shapes - and is shaped by - the Internet - Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb (2018)</cite>:</strong>
                <em>A summary as I understand the paper:</em>
                <p>This reading speaks mainly about how the internet helps with three types of economic frictions that are intimately interrelated. As named by Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb (2018):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communication costs</li>
                    <li>Transportation costs</li>
                    <li>Search costs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It also discusses how these things are impacted by the internet differently depending on the region and its needs.</p>
                <p>Communication costs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Communication costs are lower on the Internet because it is inexpensive to communicate with others, whether they are in the same building  or accross the world." (Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb, 2018)</li>
                    <li>As with everything, the above statement is true, but needs context, and in some contexts it is not as accurate. Here are some caveats as mentioned by the paper.</li>
                    <li>This reduction in cost is not as beneficial for some places as it is for others. There are other factors that impact the cost that might not make the reduction as significant, like the cost and accessibility of broadband and IT expertise. This often cause the benefits to be found more in already economically advantaged areas, and not in others. </li>
                    <li>There is also the fact that sometimes interactions between people are quite complex, and cannot necessarily be online, or be as effective online. Sometimes having online interaction the creates a bigger need for face to face interactions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Transportation costs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The transportation costs are lower in two aspects. "Firstly, for goods that can be digitized, distribution is nearly free... Secondly, for items that cannot be digitized, online interactions reduce the need for travel." (Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb, 2018)</li>
                    <li>There are also some caveats to the above statement mentioned in the paper.</li>
                    <li>With non digitizable products, there is still some costs that need to be considered. The internet does streamline some of the things, like communication, tracking etc. but there is still the cost of transporting the goods, which can make these objects very expensive if you live far away from where the product is made. This does somewhat make the impact of the lower cost of transportation less significant.</li>
                    <li>The reduction in these costs are very much context dependent. Some things you just cannot do online, like important negotiations for business. In these situations, the cost of transportation has not significantly been lowered.</li>
                    <li>The benefits of this cost reduction is also more significant in areas that have a well established digital infrastructure, but areas that do not have this do not benefit from this as much, as they still need to make use of more traditional ways of doing things.</li>
                    <li>There are also broader economic and environmental considerations to be made. Online shopping is a good example where the more individuals buy things, the more delivery vehicles will be on the road, making the transportation costs higher because it heightens traffic congestion as well as carbon emmisions. Thus, it kind of negates some of the benefits of having online shopping and communication in situations like these.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Search Costs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"If communication costs and transportation costs fall, then it is easier to compare potential choices before making a selection." (Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb, 2018)</li>
                    <li>Some things that might negate this mentioned in the paper:</li>
                    <li>Because the internet provides a large amount of information, the user might encounter outdated or biased information, which might make making decisions harder instead of streamlining the process.</li>
                    <li>These benefits are not equally felt throughout all regions. Some regions might not have good internet access or digital literacy, making the benefits of being able to search and compare things on the internet a bit of a moot point for them.</li>
                    <li>These benefits might impact more traditional business models, that are not easy to digitize.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This paper shows the benefits of internet and its uses, but it also shows where it possibly might fall short or where the benefits do not necessarily benefit everyone.</p>
            
                <strong>How do these relate and how do they impact my thinking about web developer as a South African:</strong>
                <p>These papers both show how the internet is not accessible to everyone, just in different situations. The first one shows the lack of accessibility in certain areas of the world and how that can have a negative effect in a myriad of different ways. The second one shows how the internet brought many positive benefits, but how these benefits cannot always be felt by people who are in areas that do not necessarily have as much accessibility to the internet for different reasons.</p>
                <p>For me as a developer in South Africa, the first thing that came up with me, is how can I make my websites in such a way that it is more accessible to a wide variety of people in a wide variety of regions. As someone who is able to access the internet rather easily, I think it is important for me to remember that not everyone can and that some people do not have enough data or strong enough internet to do so. So, I went to Google, and looked up how I can make my websites less data intensive. this might help make it easier for more people to access it.</p>
                <p>I found an article on Linked In (n.d.) called <cite><a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-some-ways-optimize-website-design-low-bandwidth" target="_blank">"What are some ways to optimize website design for low bandwidth?"</a></cite> and it mentions some things that I think would be really useful to remember when making websites:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using responsive design, so that the website resizes itself to the screen size, in order to prevent unnecessary scrolling and zooming, and it saves bandwidth.</li>
                    <li>By compressing images and files you can reduce loading times.</li>
                    <li>By simplifying design elements. Basically, don't go to ham on making it look pretty.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There is more, but these are the things that I think is easy to do, and makes sense at my current skill level.</p>
