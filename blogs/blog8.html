            <article class="entry-content" id="postEntry">
                
                <p>The piece I decided to do a close reading on is the piece by Sheena Magenya (2020), named <cite><a href ="https://www.genderit.org/editorial/making-feminist-internet-africa-why-internet-needs-african-feminists-and-feminisms">"Making A feminist Internet In Africa: Why The Internet Needs African Feminists and Feminisms."</a></cite></p>
                <p>The piece talks about how there should be more African Feminists on the internet, because we need greater amounts of content about the experiences of people that are different from the norm (or rather things that should be seen as normal, but isn't). Content from women, members of the LGBTQIA+, people who live with disabilities, and people who do not fall into what is seen as the 'norm'.</p>
                <p>I will be quoting a few things from the reading and speak about what my thoughts are:</p>
                <p><em>"... and therein lies the problem: presenting the internet as a solution to a social problem, as some kind of communication silver bullet that imagines an equality of access, use and representation on the internet which is false."</em></p>
                <p>This piece was written in 2020, which was... an interesting time for all of us. Now, after the pandemic, or at least after lock down, we still use online means of attending class, having meetings and so on. This reading mentions how "equal access, use and representation" was not a thing back then, and it still isn't. Even after the years of having this issue blatantly displayed in front of us, we still haven't solved it. There are still countless amounts of people who cannot use or access online means of communication.</p>
                <p>The representation of people places in the world other than in North America and in Europe was not great in 2015 as shown by Graham, De Sabbata and Zook (2015) in <cite>'Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations ad a mapping of the geographies of information.'</cite> This was written in 2015, yes, but I cannot imagine that it is much better today. Just looking at my feeds on social media, I often struggle to find people from places other than the Global North, which could be two things: There are not enough people from these places on these platforms, or these platforms stops me from seeing them.</p>
                <p><em>"Online gender-based violence, for example, has been a pressing concern raised by many women, LGBTQIA and gender non-conforming people, but legislation that recognises and acts on these attacks and violence is largely absent in many African countries."</em></p>
                <p>I feel this is a genuine issue. There are way too many spaces online where gender-based violence has become the norm and acceptable, and I genuinely think this is dangerous. It reinforces the actions of people who participate in GBV, which could have real life consequences. Many social media apps have systems that are supposed to remove these violent things, but more times than not, it removes the wrong things, or flags the wrong things. These systems are something that the owners of these platforms need to address and soon. This is also why I strongly agree with the sentiment of this piece. Having more diversity on these platforms, and having people talk about these problems will bring awareness, and hopefully change.</p>
                <p><em>"Our continent is the space where Western pharmaceutical companies come to test drugs illegally."</em></p>
                <p>This is just straight up horrifying. It often shocks me how the superpowers in the world look down on Africa and do not see that the people that live here are important and deserve respect. This should be a given, but it is extremely upsetting to see that it is not. I was not aware that this was happening, but this is why I enjoy the wide range of reading material that we receive, because I am learning about things like this. I think it is important for people to know about it, and condemn it. The more awareness things like these gets, the better.</p>
                <p><em>"The internet is also a site of great violence that is directed at people who express themselves in ways and voices that do not conform."</em></p>
                <p>This is something I have seen on the internet countless times. Someone would just be living their lives, doing what they love and sharing that love with others, and then a handful of people would come around and ruin it for them, just because they think they can. And very often, the systems that are supposed to remove and condemn this behaviour doesn't. This is something that I think should be addressed online, but also offline. it is something that we should teach our young, and our not so young is unacceptable behaviour.</p>
                <p>I feel that this is an important sentiment not only when it comes to the issues specifically addressed by this piece, but with a lot of unacceptable behaviour. We as people have to correct our peers or anyone we see who participate in these harmful activities, online and offline. It is important to not reinforce things like GBV, racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. by staying silent, whether this is online and offline. I have said many times that platforms need to work on their systems to prevent behaviour like this, but that is not the only thing. Firstly, often that won't happen, and secondly, it is something that needs to be addressed by society as well.</p>
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
                <p>This piece brings up a very important topic, and it is something that was important in 2020, but it is something that is important now as well. There needs to be more people from all over the continent on the internet, to combat the incorrect narrative that is spun about Africa. It is important to hear from the people that live in Africa, and experiences day to day life on the continent, because that is where the truth about Africa lies.</p>
                <p>I think it is important to have more African Feminists on the internet, to bring awareness to problems like GBV that is experienced on the internet and in real life daily, and it is important for us a s a society to condemn those actions.</p>
