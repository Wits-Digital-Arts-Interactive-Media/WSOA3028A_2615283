            <strong>Development process:</strong>
            <p>I was really struggling when it came to the implementation of the JavaScript in my website. The main problem I ran into is that many of the things I wanted to implement, you really needed to use CSS as well, and that made it a little hard to implement the JavaScript on its own. Where I ended up using it, except for the main navigation in the website was in the following places:
            <ul>
                <li>Navigation to the newest entry to the blogs and essays.
                    <ul>
                        <li>I really wanted to enable the user to be able to view the latest blogs and essays from the home page, so I used what I learnt from the navigation JavaScript, to make it that only the most recent post shows up as a link on the home page. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I made a back to the top button.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some of the pages had a lot on them, so the user would have to scroll a lot to be able to reach the bottom and then the top again. Thus, I added code to a button that takes the page back to the top. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There is the normal navigation
                    <ul>
                        <li>I struggled for a very long time with this, as I struggled to get it to work. But after I left it for a while, I realized you needed to give it a bit of time for your changes to get to the website itself. No idea why, but after changing things I would give it 10 minutes before checking whether it works, and that seemed to work.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I added code that made the blog post headings in the index get bigger when the mouse hovers over it.
                    <ul>
                        <li>I was messing around with this a bit, mostly to see if I could do it, but I do think that it adds to the website. It makes it a bit more alive and makes it clear to the user what they are going to click on. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            What I found useful about the coding in JavaScript I did for these elements, I don't have to do it again, I can just call it in the pages I need ti and it does the work for me. It definitely streamlined the few things I added it to and plan to add it to in the future. I also think a lot of it are things I can use in other places for other uses as well. </p>
            <p>Some things that I attempted, but was not successful in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Making a Nav for the blog post links on the blog post index page:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I sat with this for quite a while, as I thought it would be useful to do on the essay page and the portfolio page, but I was not able to do it. I was trying to follow similar logic to what was done in the normal navigation, but I was not able to get it to work.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Making a 'Next and Previous' navigation section on the bottom of the blog page. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>I was kind of upset that I could not get this one to work, as I thought it would be really cool, but I ran out of time and had some other things I still needed to finish before submitting. I think that using an array would be smart, I am just struggling a little in fully implementing it, but I definitely plan on coming back to it. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <strong>Reflection on reading:</strong>
            <p>Reading: <cite>Birhane, A. (2020) 'Algorithmic Colonization of Africa'</cite>, SCRIPTed, 17(2), pp. 389-409. doi: 10.2966/scrip.170220.389. </p>
            <p>This was an extremely interesting and eye opening read, I must say.</p>
            <p>To summarize the reading I would like to give a quote from the abstract: "In the Global South, technology that is developed with Western perspectives, values, and interests is imported with little regulation or critical scrutiny." This reading goes into how the technologies that are being imported into non-Western countries, were not developed with the right perspectives for the non-Western countries. Not to mention that these technologies have many biases already embedded in them, and are not as "neutral" as some companies would like you to believe. These biased technologies perpetuate colonial ideologies under the guise of statements like 'it is revolutionary technology' and it is 'state-of-the-art' when these technologies only perpetuate old biases and discriminatory ideas, and puts some extra money in the western rich's pocket. </p>
            <p>This reading made my distrust for social media that has been made in the Global North even more. When the reading mentioned how Facebook basically assigned themselves, "...the authority responsible for mapping, controlling, and creating population knowledge of the continent." I was anything but excited. It is scary to see how many things that we use on the daily basis, that claim to be 'safe', 'unbiased' and 'neutral', is anything but that. And how these colonial ideologies are casually being wormed into everything we interact with on the daily, and how in some cases it is praised. It makes me upset to know that many of the newest AI and technologies are made and used to manipulate for an extra bit of money, and all that to the detriment of people on the sidelines. </p>
            <p>The section "Context Matters" in the reading, was a really fascinating piece, as it made a lot of sense and made me think over the things I use on the daily. It talks about how something made to solve the problems in one culture might not work and solve the problems in another culture. This is something that I think is important for us as South African developers to keep in mind when we make websites for others to use. We need to be critical of the things we use, and really assess whether it will work in our context and help solve the problems we encounter. I think it is often better to search for solutions locally, as local solutions are catered to our local needs.</p>
