                <strong>Research: Internet, Society and Design Justice.</strong>
                <p>The reading I found the most interesting was Computer Science Communities: Who is speaking, and who is listening to the women? by Marc Cheong, Kobi Leins and Simon Coghlan (2021). I found the study done on women in computer science, and whether women in computer sciences are recognised to be extremely interesting, but also somewhat concerning. The statistics look bleak, to be frank. </p>
                <p>As the study mentions, it has concentrated mostly on women in these areas and not all minorities. However, as they mention and as I saw in reading the paper, almost everything they mention is also applicable to other minorities. They also mention that they refer to women in this aspect as "minoritised" and not necessary as a "minority" because "... those represented are not necessarily in the minority more widely speaking, but rather are effectively kept in the minority for a wide range of reasons, usually by a dominant group." (Cheong, Kobi & Coghlan, 2021). </p>
                <p>In this blog post, I will also be speaking more on women's experiences in this, as this is something I have experienced and feel I can speak on to some degree. I do not feel as qualified to speak on the experience of other minority groups, as I am not a part of them and do not know the full extent of their experience. But, even in just speaking on the experience of women, there is a plethora of articles on the internet that speaks on this issue, and why it is such an issue. And that is only when it comes to women. The issues when it comes to minority groups is an even bigger fish to fry. This, however, is supposed to be a blog post and not a seventeen page essay, so I will keep within the bounds of speaking on the experience of women in the tech industry. </p>
                <p>In reading the article, my mouth hung open at the statistics of women in the tech industry, and the women being recognized in the tech industry. Admittedly, this study does not go into specific places in the world and their tech industries, although they do mention that in Malaysia in one of their computer sciences faculties, 40% of the post graduate students are female (Cheong, Kobi & Coghlan, 2021). This is encouraging, but when the study looked into the published papers, and the ratio between female and male, my hope dwindled a little. </p>
                <p>After reading this, I had some questions that popped up. There are so few females in the tech industry, but why? One big excuse I found in several articles are "Girls are just not interested in Computer Science." This seems like a cop out and not a good excuse. Why? Why are they not interested? More often than not there are reasons that people do not like things, it very rarely "is what it is" (contrary to popular belief). (Articles that tried to refute this excuse, and where I saw this excuse: "Girls Just Don't Like Computer Science" Isn't a Good Enough Excuse, Pearcy (2019); The Lack Of Women In Computer Science Isn't The Cause Of Tech's Diversity Problem, Birnir (2019); There Are Too Few Women in Computer Science and Engineering, Cheryan, Master & Meltzoff (2022))</p>
                <p>As Pearcy (2019) states, there are a lot of things preventing women from going into computer science or tech, and it is not only because of a lack of interest. So in this blog post I would like to list some of the reasons why there are fewer women in tech and why there is less interest, and maybe pose some of the solutions I found, as well as some solutions I thought of in my long debate with my boyfriend about this: </p>
                
                <strong>"Lack of visible role models" (Pearcy, 2019):</strong>
                <p>When looking at media, majority of the people in tech positions in movies and shows are male. It is rare that we see a female in that position. But an even bigger problem is that the women that do have success stories in tech, are basically erased. They do not get recognized for their involvement. Some examples Pearcy (2019) mentions are the women that were behind the first computer was not mentioned when it was showcased in 1946; "... how Katherine Johnson, the NASA mathematician who calculated the orbital trajectory of the first manned U.S. spaceflight was barely mentioned in the coverage of the flight..." (Pearcy, 2019) and how in a recent news segment in furthering female interest in tech, there were no reference to female lead organizations.  </p>
                <p>Wolfson (2015) also gives reasons as to why women are often not recognized in tech. She provides 3 figures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Round about 18% of Computer Science degrees goes to women.</li>
                    <li>Around 70% of the workers in Google and Facebook are male.</li>
                    <li>Less than 17% of people in the tech industry are women. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Having so few women in these industries, and having them unrecognized, solidifies the idea that the tech and computer industry is for boys, which I personally think can become a dangerous ideology. </p>
                
                <strong>There is not enough exposure at a young age (Pearcy, 2019):</strong>
                <p>Even though this is not necessary for a woman to be successful in tech and developer jobs (Birnir, 2019) if the stereotypes like 'programming being a boys thing' were refuted, we might have less of a lack in women in the tech industry. Girls are often told that boys basically start their interest and skills in things like programming from an early age, so a lot of girls feel like they are not qualified or do not have enough skills to be programming or be involved in tech, so they quit (Pearcy, 2019). </p>

                <strong>There are many misconceptions about tech and computer science (Flavin, 2018):</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>The math that needs to be done is extremely difficult. This is something that effects both genders, but with girls that have historically been told not to go into mathematics, it tends to have a greater effect on them. (Flavin, 2018)</li>
                    <li>"The work environment is hostile to women." (Flavin, 2018). And yes, sometimes it is, but it is not nearly as prevalent as some make it seem. It is usually a few individuals, but overall, it is not that much of a problem. (Flavin, 2018)</li>
                    <li>Computer science is not considered to be very feminine (Flavin, 2018). I am going to interject here with my own opinion a little bit... what? Since when does a career path have a gender? Yes, it is more male dominated, but I am pretty sure you can be a good programmer and still love feminine things and be feminine.</li>
                    <li>Because women are often not exposed to tech at a young age, or lose interest at a young age, they cannot be taught to be a programmer, developer or computer scientist at college age. The problem with this is that it takes the responsibility off of these departments in universities and in companies and puts it on women. They ignore the fact that women sometimes avoid these career paths because of rampant misogyny and sexism in there career paths, and blame it on them 'losing interest' (Birnir, 2019). (I am living proof that gaining an interest in tech later in life does not make me a lost cause for a tech job.)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These are just some misconceptions, some that grabbed my attention, there are many more, but this might get a bit long if I go on. </p>
                <p>The above named are just a few reasons why women do not go into tech, and a lot of it comes down to stereotypes and how we talk about these career paths. It saddens me that so few women go into tech, because I think women can bring a whole new perspective on so many topics. In my opinion, however, I think this is something that everyone needs to work on. We need to work on breaking the stereotypes, encouraging young girls who are interested in the sciences and tech, and encouraging grown women to pursue these careers if they are interested. We need to work on the cases of sexism and misogyny and the work place, and work to get rid of them. By not having more women in these career paths, not only women are missing out, but the areas of research are missing out on more talented minds and more perspectives. </p>

                <strong>Some possible solutions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encourage girls from an early age (Pearcy, 2019)</li>
                    <li>There is a long list of organisations working to get women in tech. A great list is given by Birnir (2019) in her article, that is linked in the references. I feel that supporting these organisations could only help these causes. </li>
                    <li>We need to put more female tech role-models at the forefront of tech conversations. </li>
                    <li>We as a society as well as the tech industry need to work on changing the narrative, and in doing so encourage more women to join the tech industry (Cheryan, Master & Meltzoff, 2022)</li>
                </ul>
