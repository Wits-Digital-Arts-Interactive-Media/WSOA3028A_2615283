                <h1 class = "entry-title">UI & UX Analysis of Laerskool Oranjegloed Primary’s Website:</h1>
                <p>The website analysed for this essay is the website for Laerskool Oranjegloed Primary (n.d.) in
                    Secunda.</p>
                <p>In this analysis I will be describing the intention of this website according to the lecture
                    material kindly given to us by Hanli Geyser (2024), then I will move to the ethical UX/UI
                    principles that are relevant to the website, and whether it adheres to these considerations.</p>
                <strong>The intention of this website:</strong>
                <p>I followed the same process that Hanli Geyser (2024) gave us in her lecture material about the
                    UI and UX processes. The elements that I looked at are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goal of the website.</li>
                    <li>The website user goal.</li>
                    <li>The type of content that the website should display.</li>
                    <li>Easily understandable interface elements.</li>
                </ul>
                <em>Goal of the website:</em>
                <p>This is the website used by the primary school to provide important information about the
                    school. This should include information about the staff, schedules, school rules, extra mural
                    activities provided, where to register, photos from events held at the school, and any
                    important announcements.</p>
                <p>This website does provide easy access to many of these elements, but there are a few of them
                    that have not recently been updated.</p>
                <p>Information about the staff, school rules, where to register and photos from events are very
                    easily accessible through the navigation bar and seem to be up to date. The schedules for
                    extra mural activities, as well as any other information about these activities, have not been
                    updated. There is also no announcement section that I can find.</p>
                <em>The website user goal:</em>
                <p>The user of this website is the parent of a new student or the parent of an already enrolled
                    student.</p>
                <p>The parent of a new student would need information about the school, the school rules, the staff, and the process of registration. This parent would need as much information about the school as possible, to be able to make the right choice for their child.</p>
                <p>The parent of a current student might need access to the rules for a refresh or reference, they would need access to the schedules, and they would need access to any important announcements.</p>
                <em>The type of content that the website should display:</em>
                <p>This website needs to display information that is relevant to the users named above. Schedules, rules, registration information, and announcements should be easily found. These are the most important parts of a website for a school.</p>
                <p>The information about extra mural activities, or photos from events are secondary elements for a website like this.</p>
                <p>In this website, the rules, registration information, and photos are easily accessible, but schedules and announcements have not been updated.</p>
                <em>Easily understandable interface elements:</em>
                <p>An easily understandable interface is very important when it comes to accessibility and ease of use. When just looking at the website’s interface elements, there are some very useful elements that this page makes use of.</p>
                <p>One that I find to be very useful is the arrow that appears when you scroll down far enough. This arrow takes you back to the top of the page, where the navigational elements are.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images-in-essays/Arrow.png" alt="Teal square with white triangle creating upwards arrow." title="Navigational Arrow">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1: Navigational Arrow (Laerskool Oranjegloed Primary, n.d.)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The navigation bar at the top of the page is done very well. The way it is arranged is very logical and easy to navigate. The headings are descriptive, and the subcategories within them are easily understandable, making navigating the website easy.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images-in-essays/Banner.png" alt="Banner on the top of the website with the navigational tools and the school emblem." title="Oranjegloed website banner.">
                    <figcaption>Figure 2: Navigation Panel (Laerskool Oranjegloed Primary, n.d.)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Most of the buttons used on the page are formatted in such a way that it is easily discernible as a button and take the user to the relevant page. The buttons in the Extra Mural Activities section, however, are not formatted as clearly. At first glance, I thought the page was formatted in tables, but I soon realised the headings in the tables were buttons that display the relevant information when clicked.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images-in-essays/NetballScheduleStuff.png" alt="Image of where the schedule for Netball practice is supposed to be, but it is empty, just a white square with a heading and a sub-heading." title="Netball Schedule">
                    <figcaption>Figure 3: Extra Mural Information Page, Netball Section (Laerkool oranjegloed Primary, n.d.)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>These are some of the elements just at face value, some of them look great and others need work.</p>
                <strong>In line with the intentions of the website, what relevant principles should reasonably be considered:</strong>
                <p>After researching ethics principles for UX and UI design, I have gathered 8 principles that are relevant to this website and the intentions of the website. These principles are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Usability
                        <ul>
                            <li>The usability of a website, or product according to Ghanchi (2021) refers to how a user can achieve a certain goal effectively as well as satisfactorily when using the website or product.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Accessibility
                        <ul>
                            <li>According to Sachdeva (2023), interfaces need to be designed in such a way that they: “…can be used by individuals with varying physical and cognitive abilities.” (Sachdeva, 2023). Websites need to be designed in such a way that anyone can easily use them, no matter what the limitations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Responsiveness
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is about whether the website can be used on different types of devices, be that computer screens or mobile devices (Sachdeva, 2023).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Feedback
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is how the website lets the user know how their actions have had an effect. They want to know if their actions have been completed, if there are any errors, or how long something may take to load (Sachdeva, 2023).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Reduction of Cognitive Load
                        <ul>
                            <li>A complicated user interface will cause users to become frustrated and not want to use the website. Devoq Design (2023) states it the best when they state that: “By streamlining interfaces, adhering to design conventions, and minimizing distractions, UX designers… can enhance user well-being by making interactions smoother and more intuitive.”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Influence
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is something we must be careful about because there is a thin line between ethical and unethical practices when it comes to the persuasion of your users. (Ghanchi, 2021).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Transparency and Privacy
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sites should only collect essential information (Team Designlab, 2024) and they should be transparent about the information that is collected and why (Devoq Design, 2023).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Inclusivity
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Inclusivity goes beyond accessibility and means designing products and services that are inclusive of all users, regardless of their race, gender, sexuality, or ability.” (Sachdeva, 2023). We as designers need to be mindful of being inclusive to everyone who might use our sites.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Does the website adhere to these considerations:</strong>
                <p><em>Usability:</em></p>
                <p>As a parent that must use this website, there are aspects of it that add to the usability and elements that don’t.</p>
                <p>One great part is that every page is accessible with just two or three clicks from anywhere on the website. And whenever the user is on a subsection of a certain page, it is easy to go back to the main page, without having to go through the main navigation.</p>
                <p>This website gives access to most of the most important information about the school. The school rules, code of conduct, disciplinary system, and school uniform information are easily accessible, along with information about the staff and what the school provides.</p>
                <p>Where the problem lies, is that not everything is up to date. The page that is supposed to contain the information is easily accessible, but the information is not there. This may cause frustration.</p>
                <p>Other than the missing information, navigating and using this website is extremely easy and intuitive.</p>

                <p><em>Accessibility:</em></p>
                <p>There are a few elements I explored with this.</p>
                <p>The first thing I looked at was the readability of the text. Generally, everything is very easy to read. The font is very readable, and the colours are contrasting enough in most places, making it easy to read.</p>
                <p>However, in certain places, the choice of background and font colour does not work. The words disappear against the background which makes it hard to read.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images-in-essays/Image.png" alt="Image of the head staff of the school, and the name and slogan of the school overlayed on the image." title="Oranjegloed head staff; school name and slogan">
                    <figcaption>Figure 4: Main image on website. Bottom text is unclear and hard to read (Laerskool Oranjegloed Primary, n.d.)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>I used the Windows Screen Reader to see whether it is easy to use on the website, were a blind person to use it. I did not find any glaring issues with this, it read out all the headings as well as the heading level, and it easily read the paragraphs. However, the screen reader had trouble reading out the images and any descriptions leading me to believe there were no descriptions on the images to read.</p>
                <p>I zoomed in on the screen to see what the website would do if someone who needed bigger text were to zoom in. The website reacted accordingly, making the text bigger, adjusting the element positions, and by extension making it easier to read.</p>
                <p>The final thing I did was change the colour filters in the settings, to see whether colour-blind individuals would have a problem viewing this website using filters. There were not any glaring problems, except that the previously mentioned background and font colour issues seem to be worse in some areas. Although it was not terrible, some more contrast in those colours would be beneficial.</p>

                <p><em>Responsiveness:</em></p>
                <p>This website is built to be extremely responsive. As I mentioned before, I zoomed in on the pages, and the website reacted accordingly.</p>
                <p>I also opened the website on my phone and saw that everything was still easily accessible, and easy to use.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images-in-essays/mobileView.png" alt="Mobile view of the Oranjegloed website. It shows the top bannes, the dropdown for the navigations and the image of the head staff with the school name overlayed." title="Oranjegloed website on mobile.">
                    <figcaption>Figure 5: Website in mobile view (Laerskool Oranjegloed Primary, n.d.)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This website has no problems with this aspect.</p>

                <p><em>Feedback:</em></p>
                <p>This website has very little feedback, however, it is not a website that needs too much. It uses the feedback that it does make use of very well.</p>
                <p>Every link and every button react accordingly when interacted with. When the link for ‘Our Team’ is clicked, for example, it immediately takes the user to the page that shows the staff members.</p>
                <p>Some smaller reactions make the website feel even better to use. Some of the buttons and links have animations when the mouse hovers over them, giving the website a little more juice and making it more enjoyable to use.</p>

                <p><em>Reduction of Cognitive Load:</em></p>
                <p>This website has a very simple and easily understandable interface. None of the pages contain massive text walls that are hard to keep track of or understand, and there are no distractions. Everything is set out very clearly and logically, making it easy to use and read.</p>

                <p><em>Influence:</em></p>
                <p>I cannot find any aspect of this website that uses any unethical means to persuade a user to sign up for the school. The registration link is easily accessible through a quirky button in the corner of the screen that moves when the mouse hovers over it, but that is it.</p>
                <p>This website is dedicated to giving information about the school, its staff members and what the school provides. The website does not use any concerning methods to convince the user of anything.</p>

                <p><em>Transparency and Privacy:</em></p>
                <p>The only place that the user can insert any of their personal information is when they do an online registration.</p>
                <p>At first glance, I was concerned, as you needed to enter your ID number to continue. However, when looking closely, there is a link to all the privacy information and laws that pertain to this information. These are easily accessible through the links, and everything is laid out clearly in these documents.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images-in-essays/SignUp.png" alt="Sign up page for the school website. I it a white and teal square, with spaces to fill in an ID number and cell number. It also shows the school emblem." title="Sign up page for Oranjegloed school.">
                    <figcaption>Figure 6: Registration portal (Laerskool Oranjegloed Primary, n.d.)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>It would have been beneficial to have a note on that page stating what the information will be used for and why, but the information is available.</p>

                <p><em>Inclusivity:</em></p>
                <p>I do not have much to say about the website in this aspect, because there is no evidence that any aspect of the website is excluding anyone based on their race, gender, or sexuality. (I have mentioned some problems with accessibility for people with impaired abilities above). Any images used on the website are very inclusive and do not exclude anyone, from what I can see.</p>
                <p>Inclusivity is something the website and by extension, the school seems to stand for.</p>

                <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
                <p>This website overall does not have any obvious issues, however, there are a few things that would be beneficial to change.</p>
                <p>The main thing would be the colours used for the text. Some of the colours mix into the background too much and are quite hard to see. This could be an issue when people who are colourblind and/or visually impaired use the website.</p>
                <p>Adding text to the images that a screen reader can read, for people who are visually impaired to be able to use the website, would be beneficial.</p>
                <p>Adding a short piece of text in the registration portal letting the user know what their information is and is not used for would be beneficial in making users feel safer when using it.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, I feel this is a good example of a website that considers ethical principles and is committed to keeping with its goal and helping users achieve their goals.</p>
