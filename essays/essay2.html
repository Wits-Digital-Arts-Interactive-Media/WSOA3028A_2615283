        <h1>Essay 2: Digital Colonialism.</h1>
        <div class = "firstContentWrapper">
            <div class="entry-content">
                <p>For this essay, I will start by discussing digital colonialism, using Sareeta Amrute’s (2019) keynote talk on Tech Colonialism Today 
                    as a point of departure. I will relate this to the labour situation in global software development by looking at Google’s decision to 
                    lay off hundreds of employees and outsource those jobs to developers in Mexico and India (Elias, 2024) as well as examples of other tech 
                    companies outsourcing work to lower-income countries, and how this could be exploitative. I will relate this to the colonial use of 
                    software and technology in South Africa. I will finish with my understanding of my place in the sector and my role, as a white South 
                    African, in decoloniality.</p>
                <p>My understanding of tech colonialism is based on using Amrute’s (2019) keynote talk as a framework. As Amrute (2019) states, “A colonial 
                    relationship is: hierarchical, extractive and exploitative” (Amrute, 2019). Companies that produce the newest technologies have also 
                    produced the idea that they, a small group in Silicon Valley, are the best people to create and distribute these technologies. They 
                    believe they are superior to others. This could be called techno-chauvinism, a term coined by Meredith Broussard (2019, cited in Amrute, 
                    2019). This illustrates shows the hierarchical aspects of technology, as the idea that others might also be able to achieve the same 
                    things, given the right resources, does not seem feasible to this group. Secondly, tech is extractive. Especially when it comes to data, 
                    materials, and knowledge. Data is extracted when citizens use online applications, where the terms of service enable the tech giants to 
                    capture any data they want. Minerals and materials are needed to create significant massive amounts of tech devices, so they are 
                    extracted in large volumes, often without considering the detrimental effect it has on the environment and communities. Knowledge is 
                    extracted from other countries outside of the Global North, to be used to their benefit. Finally, tech is exploitative. The main forms 
                    of exploitation found in tech are the outsourcing of labour and the large amount of hidden labour that goes into creating and upholding 
                    tech and tech companies (Amrute, 2019).</p>
                <p>When looking at digital colonialism in the context of global software development, I will be focusing on the possible exploitation of 
                    workers in low-wage countries. Before I continue, I need to address what constitutes a fair wage. I have considered several views and 
                    decided that for this essay, I will use what the United Nations Global Compact (n.d.) states it to be, “… it is a wage that enables 
                    workers and their families to meet their basic needs” (United Nations Global Compact, n.d.). (However, this is not necessarily a minimum 
                    wage, as a minimum wage is often not enough to be able to afford all basic needs (United Nations Global Compact, n.d.)).</p>
                <p>When studying the article by Jennifer Elias (2024) about Google’s decision to lay off many employees and move those jobs to India and 
                    Mexico because it is more cost-effective, a few aspects caught my eye. There is the problem of jobs being moved from the USA to another 
                    country, meaning that there are people left without jobs in the USA. Because it is cheaper to outsource work, local companies who do not 
                    wish to outsource their work, run the risk of not being able to compete with companies that do choose to outsource (Ukpere & Bayat, 2012). 
                    I do acknowledge that this is a problem. There is a case to be made that with innovation, new jobs will be created, however, this might 
                    also not be true (Ukpere & Bayat, 2012). For this essay, however, I would like to focus on the implications for the countries to which the 
                    work is being outsourced.</p>
                <p>There is a positive aspect to outsourcing work from the Global North to lower-income countries. It does inject money into those communities 
                    and boost their economy. This is assuming, however, that the workers doing these outsourced jobs are being compensated with a fair wage. 
                    Doing further research into big technological companies from the USA and their outsourcing practices, I found two concerning examples, 
                    namely Facebook and OpenAI. Both these companies outsourced content moderation work to a company in Kenya named Samasource, later renamed 
                    Sama.</p>
                <p>In 2019, Facebook was outsourcing content moderation work to Sama. A South African worker was hired there, under the notion that he would be 
                    an IT administrator but was instead given the job as a content moderator for Facebook, where he would spend approximately nine hours a day, 
                    looking at atrocious content to determine whether it violates content policies. He would only be paid around $1.50/hour, without proper 
                    psychiatric support (Bracy & Dark, 2023).</p>
                <p>In 2021, OpenAI outsourced similar work to Sama. OpenAI sent a large number of heinous pieces of text to Sama, where workers were expected 
                    to read them, label them, and send them back for between $1.32 and $2 an hour, again without proper psychiatric support (Perrigo, 2023).</p>
                <p>The minimum wage in Nairobi, Kenya in 2019 and 2021 was around 13 600 Kenyan Shilling per month (Trading Economics, 2024). Considering a 
                    nine-hour workday, five days a week for four weeks, the minimum wage is around 76 Kenyan Shillings per hour. In 2019 that would have been 
                    $0.76 and in 2021 $0.68 (Exchange Rates.org.ukm, 2024). Comparing that to the between $1.32 and $2 these workers are being paid per hour, 
                    it seems that they should be quite well off. However, the living wage in Kenya in 2019 is 29 546 Kenyan Shillings and 29 257 Kenyan 
                    Shillings in 2021 (Anker & Anker, 2019; Anderson et al., 2021). (This is only one opinion; some other sources claim it to be even higher). 
                    Thus, per hour it would be 164.15 Kenyan Shillings ($1.64) and 162.54 Kenyan Shillings ($1.46) respectively. This means that in 2019, 
                    these workers were being paid below, what is considered, living wage standards by more than 2 000 Kenyan Shillings per month, and in 2021, 
                    many workers were being paid below the living wage standard by just under 3 000 Kenyan Shillings per month. 2 000 to 3 000 Kenyan Shillings 
                    is enough to cover most of a person’s monthly utilities in Nairobi, Kenya, today (Numbeo, 2024).</p>
                <p>I understand the argument that these workers are being paid by the company they work for, and thus it is not the responsibility of the big 
                    tech companies. However, I disagree. These tech companies have a responsibility to research the outsourcing companies they use to make sure 
                    that the workers are paid fairly and have good working conditions. The information about Sama paying the workers below a living wage and 
                    not providing proper psychiatric support is freely available, and they should have been asking these questions, not only for the benefit of 
                    the workers but also for the benefit of their company’s reputation. The articles mentioned and the many others available in the public 
                    domain on this topic negatively affect their brand. It makes their claims of doing it for the benefit of these countries and not only for 
                    profit, ingenuine.</p>
                <p>Micheal Kwet (2018) in his piece ‘Digital Colonialism: US Empire and New Imperialism in the Global South’ Kwet (2018) writes about many ways 
                    that large tech companies in the USA have colonised and are colonising countries in the Global South. He uses South Africa as an example. 
                    The one I will be focusing on is “Feature #4: Imperial State Surveillance” (Kwet, 2018). As South Africans, we face the threat of our 
                    private details being stolen daily, and this is an urgent problem that needs addressing.</p>
                <p>The USA has been part of surveilling South Africa for more than a century now. Back in the late 1900s, USA mining officials were very 
                    keen on surveilling black miners working for them at the time. Half a century later, IBM provided the systems used to implement 
                    apartheid between races, with other USA companies profiting off the oppression of Black South Africans, with many other examples 
                    as well. The USA surveillance became less prominent when South Africa became a democracy in 1994, but they made a full- force return 
                    in the early 2000s when technology started developing at a massive speed (Kwet, 2018).</p>
                <p>When the large tech companies made their return with new developments and applications, extraction of data from South Africans (knowingly 
                    and unknowingly) became the norm. William Binney (2013, as cited in Kwet, 2018), a whistleblower for the NSA (National Security Agency) 
                    made people aware that they are collecting trillions of pieces of data like, “… phone calls and emails, in addition to sources like banking 
                    and social networking” (Kwet, 2018).</p>
                <p>Even though South Africa is not considered a third-world country, it is still vulnerable to extraction and exploitation from countries in 
                    the Global North. This was true in the late 1900s, and it is unfortunately still true. It makes me wonder whether having technology created 
                    by these large companies so widespread throughout the country is more dangerous than we might anticipate. While doing research for this 
                    essay, I realised increasingly that our data is anything but safe, especially when using the internet as much as we do. Even when trying 
                    to safeguard our data, such as using a VPN, someone receives a profit. It is hard to see the light when our knowledge of this becomes more 
                    obvious.</p>
                <p>This makes it difficult for South African developers. Not only is our data in danger as South African citizens but many of us are being 
                    recruited by other countries (Business Tech, 2022). This means software companies in South Africa are struggling to find skilled employees. 
                    On top of this, to fight large tech companies in their colonial practices, software developers are needed in the country to counteract 
                    these effects by keeping the technology developed locally, transparently and publicly owned (Kwet, 2018). However, if many South African 
                    software developers find better opportunities internationally, this might be easier said than done.</p>
                <p>It is challenging to exactly understand what my place is in this sector. The examples mentioned above of how tech is colonial, even more 
                    than I realized at first, make the industry feel very… fearsome. Especially considering I am still a student. However, if I must contemplate 
                    what I think my place should be as a South African software developer, I will aim to focus on transparency, honesty, and inclusivity. 
                    The dominating issue I see with all the examples mentioned above is that there are a lot of things happening that people are unaware of. 
                    When it comes to light, it is obvious that it is morally and often ethically wrong. Doing this as a lone developer will be hard, however. 
                    I hope to find and team up with others who have the same mindset and goals.</p>
                <p>When it comes to my role in decoloniality as a white South African, I feel it is quite simple. I need to continuously educate myself on what 
                    decoloniality is, where coloniality can be found, and how to counteract it. I need to support causes and movements for decoloniality. 
                    I need to put into practice the recommendations Amrute (2019) gives on practising decolonial thinking in the workplace. I often feel as 
                    a white person I have no place to talk about decoloniality. However, I have realized that staying silent might be more damaging. Talking 
                    about it means I can learn and correct my thinking. Staying silent is not appropriate, but I must also ensure that my voice does not 
                    overshadow the voices of people of colour and researchers in this field.</p>
                <p>Decoloniality and tech colonialism are complicated and broad topics. This essay covers a small, and perhaps even an ambiguous part of it. 
                    However, it portrays my honest reflection and understanding of it supplemented with several examples. What is clear to me, though, is that 
                    tech colonialism is real and dangerous. It is happening under our noses. The main takeaway is that we all have a part to 
                    play in fighting it. It is not an easy battle, but it is a very necessary one.</p>
