                <strong>Final Design Sketches (Wireframes, Colour Blockouts and Explanation on what I changed)</strong>
                <p>Overall things that have changed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Now when the user clicks on a navigation button and goes to that page, the colour of that button changes.</li>
                        <li>Each page now has a footer.</li>
                        <li>The blog post, design logs, portfolio items and essays all have a next, previous and back to menu buttons on the bottom.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <div class="wireframeImageRow">

                </div>
                <p>Notes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>For this one, not much has changed from the previous wireframe.</li>
                        <li>The biographical info space has gotten a bit smaller (mostly because I could not think about much to say about myself).</li>
                        <li>The arrow has moved to the side of the square, which was easier to implement spacing wise. It is thus a lighter colour because it is on a dark background.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>For this, I made a bit more of a drastic change.</li>
                        <li>Instead of just showcasing the portfolio items, I decided to showcase each of the most recent posts in each section.</li>
                        <li>There is one for the blog posts, design logs, portfolio items and essays.</li>
                        <li>This gives the user easier access to the most recent activity in every section.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>For this I changed the layout a little. The rows are now showcased in fours instead of threes.</li>
                        <li>They also now contain four game items and four writing items.</li>
                        <li>Beneath this, there is the layout for the API I implemented, the random fact API (References to this in Design Log 7: Implementation documentation).</li>
