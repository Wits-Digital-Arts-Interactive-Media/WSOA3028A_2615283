                <h2>Implementation Documentation</h2>
                <h3>HTML:</h3>
                <p>As it stands, I used just the base HTML in only a few places.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I used HTML to show the content of each of the blogs, design logs, portfolio items and essays. </li>
                            <li>This is the easiest way to do it, as it is only the text. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Containers:
                        <ul>
                            <li>What I mean by containers, is that I used it to create spaces for the JavaScript to place elements (more on this later).</li>
                            <li>A good example of this is all the index pages. In HTML, there is nothing, it is all generated by JavaScript.</li>
                            <li>For this I had to use some micro-formatting.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>My micro formatting is honestly a bit of a mess. It admittedly looks better than it did a few days ago before I fixed it up a little, but it is still a mess. I am struggling to find standardised classes, IDs etc. I tried to use standardised ones as far as I could, but I had to start using my own names for classes and id’s. It is mostly because I needed some of them to be unique, as I needed to do specific things to specific elements with CSS and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>So, I tried to use names for classes and IDs that made sense for the context that it was used in, so the classes and IDs used in CSS and JavaScript are intuitive and easily traceable if there is an issue in the future.</p>
                <p>The micro-formatting still needs work though, it is nowhere near perfect. </p>
                <p>When it comes to meta-tags, I am also still a bit lost. I am currently using the ones that make the most sense, but for the final website, I am going to do some more research on what else I can implement, and how I can implement the ones I am using better. </p>
                <h3>JavaScript: </h3>
                <p>I mostly used JavaScript for two things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigational elements</li>
                    <li>Indexes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With the Navigational elements, I did the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have a main navigation that takes the user to whichever page they need to be on.</li>
                    <li>I have a hamburger menu and a navigation menu that goes with that for when the website is used on a device with a smaller screen.</li>
                    <li>I have a button that navigates the user back to the top of the current page. </li>
                    <li>My footer (I guess this can also be classified as an index, but I am putting it here) is added through JavaScript, enabling the user to go to a few of my social media profiles.</li>
                    <li>On the home page, I used JavaScript to add each of the most recent items in the blogs, the essays, and the portfolio items. In the future when new items are added, I just need to add the name and link to the JavaScript file, and it will do the rest. </li>
                    <li>I have not been able to implement JavaScript on the ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons on the bottom of each blog page yet, but that is a goal I am setting for the final website. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>With the indexes, I did the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On every page that has a list of links going to posts (blogs, design logs, portfolio items), I used JavaScript to add each of these elements along with their necessary micro formatting like classed, href and ids.</li>
                    <li>This makes my HTML much cleaner, but also streamlines a lot of coding. I do not need to type out each link with a heading and a summary, I can just have the JavaScript do it. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>CSS: </h3>
                <p>I tried to streamline this as much as possible, but it might need tweaking, which will go with the micro formatting for the HTML. This is where the general micro formatting tags let me down, and I needed to start adding my own.</p>
                <p>I used the CSS for styling, animations, and colour transitions, as well as to make the website responsive to different screen sizes. </p>
                <p>Starting with the responsiveness, I used a media query and chose a maximum size that I found to make the most sense. At that max size, the website seemed to start going haywire, so that size is where I made the website change its layout to fit smaller screen sizes. </p>
                <p>However, this was already automatically happening as I am using Flexboxes to make the implementation of responsiveness easier. It just needed a few tweaks and changes. </p>
                <p>I tested the website on a few devices, and on most of them, the designs are coming through as well as I could have hoped for, but there are 3 or 4 that it is still not as optimised as I would have liked. </p>
                <p>When it comes to the animations (Squares becoming larger when they are hovered over and colour transitions) I used CSS, as it was a lot easier and looked smoother when doing so, I did attempt some of it in JavaScript, but it felt very jarring. With CSS, it is a lot smoother.</p>
                <p>It is nowhere near perfect, I will admit, but it is getting there. There are a few elements that are not working with me as well as I would hope (the arrow on the homepage for example), and I will be doing more research on how to implement that better. </p>
