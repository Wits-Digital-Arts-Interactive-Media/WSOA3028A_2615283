                    <strong>Inspriration:</strong>
                    <p>I was looking for sleek websites that are easy to navigate and interesting to look at. I enjoy more sleek looking websites as they feel professional to me, and that is something I enjoy looking at and making. I looked at A LOT of websites, but these were the highlights for me:</p>
                                
                        <a href="https://gael-baurens.fr/" target="_blank">https://gael-baurens.fr/</a>
                                
                        <p>I enjoy the simplistic colour palette to be found in this website, as well as how reactive it is. The website feels alive, because as you scroll through the pages, the elements on the page reacts accordingly.</p>
                                
                        <a href="https://gerlogu.com/" target="_blank">https://gerlogu.com/</a>
                                
                        <p>I like how alive this website feels. Everywhere you look, every time you scroll and everywhere you hover your mouse, something reacts.</p>
                                
                        <a href="https://www.jackbromhead.com/" target="_blank">https://www.jackbromhead.com/</a>
                                
                        <p>This one also caught my eye with the colour palette. I, however, do not like that the navigation on the top only takes you to a different place on the same page. I feel like just scrolling would have been better, or even if the parts ofthe page was seperated into seperate ones, to make it easier to traverse.</p>
                                
                        <a href="https://heathsmith.net/" target="_blank">https://heathsmith.net/</a>
                                
                        <p>This one I like because of the sleekness, and because of the colour palette, however, it is not as reactive as I would like. I would like there to be more reaction as I scroll or hover my mouse. It is also quite busy on a lot of the pages.</p>
                <strong>Notes on my aesthetics and possible design elements</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>My aesthetic:
                        <ul>
                            <li>For this website I am going for a darker, more sleek style website, with a few whimsical elements (mostly just my illustration of myself). I find websites like these easier to read, and very aesthetically pleasing. I would also like to have my personality weaved within it in some way or form.</li>
                            <li>I want the colour scheme to be simple and easily readable, and not too all over the place, as to make it unreadable. It is very important to me to make sure that the colours on my website contrast, in order to make it easily readable for people who have eye problems (like me) as well as for people with colour blindness (several members of my family has this, and I have seen them struggle with this). I feel the colour scheme I have chosen contrasts enough for this to be possible.</li>
                            <li>I have always like the sleeker, more simplistic style websites, so this is what I am going for, but with a few things that make it more whimsical.</li>
                            <li>I find that simpler websites with simple colour schemes, and that are not too busy, are easier to interact with. Websites that look busy are hard for me to read and interact with, so I want to avoid this with my website.</li>
                            <li>I also find websites that have darker backgrounds easier to read on, as it is not as heavy on my eyes. And considering that I have to work on this website a lot, I think making it easier for me to read as well as anyone who has the same issue, is important.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Design elements I definitely want to implement
                        <ul>
                            <li>A navigation bar at the top of the screen that is always visible, even when you scroll down. This makes navigation very easy from whereever you are on the website, adn the user does not have to go a long way around to get to where they need to b. this lowers the chance of them getting extremely frustrated in the long run.</li>
                            <li>Some moving elements. When you scroll down, I want some of the elements to move inwards on the screen (I am still figuring out exactly how to implement this.) This will make my website more interactive and seem more alive. I want it to create visual interest, in order not to create a website that is boring to look at and traverse.</li>
                            <li>A button that takes you to the top of the screen no matter where you are on the page. I find this useful, because sometimes scrolling all the way to the top is very tedious, especially if there is a lot of content on the page. i do not know if this will be necessary once my navigation bar stays on screen, but I will test it and then decide whether it would be necessary.</li>
                            <li>Colours that clearly contrast in order to make reading the text on the pages easier. The colours I want to use are white, mint green, forest green and black. It is a good mix of light and dark, that contrasts against each other. These are simple colours but they can be used effectively in order to make certain elements on the page pop.</li>
                            <li>A limited colour palette, for the reasons given above.</li>
                            <li>When we get to CSS, I would like to add white space, in order to space the text mor to the middle of the page, but still left aligned, in order to make it easier to read.</li>
                            <li>I would really like to use the Aptos font, as I find it very easy to read, and not too fancy, but fany enough to make my website look professional, but I will be doing some more research on which fonts might work best for the website style I am trying to achieve.</li>
                        </ul>
