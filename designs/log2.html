                    <strong>Inspriration:</strong>
                    <p>I was looking for sleek websites that are easy to navigate and interesting to look at. I enjoy more sleek looking websites as they feel professional to me, and that is something I enjoy looking at and making. Sleek websites are also easier to look at for me, as they are not overly busy and do not overwhelm me. I looked at A LOT of websites, but these were the highlights for me:</p>
                                
                        <a href="https://gael-baurens.fr/" target="_blank">Gael Baurens</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The colour scheme is simplistic, but is contrasting enough to make it more accesible.</li>
                            <li>The background is black. I really enjoy this as it does not hurt my eyes. Backgrounds that are too bright can be hard to look at, so this is something I would like to implement in my website.</li>
                            <li>The website is very reactive. When you scroll or move your mouse, the website reacts accordingly.</li>
                            <li>The site feels alive. As you scroll, elements slide into frame, making the website more interesting to look at.</li>
                        </ul>
                                
                        <a href="https://gerlogu.com/" target="_blank">Germ&aacuten L&oacutepez</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I like the reactivity in this website. The site is very alive when you scroll. Things move and slide in, etc.</li>
                            <li>I do not enjoy the white background, it is a bit bright for me.</li>
                            <li>I like how the writing is spaced. It is spaced enough to make it easy for the user to read.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I also liked the colour palette on this one. Very simple and not overwhelming.</li>
                            <li>I do not like how the navigation works. When you press one of the buttons on the top of the screen it would scroll down to the relevant place. It was not what I was expecting, and caught me off guard.</li>
                            <li>If it is seperate pages, I feel it is easier to traverse.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I enjoy the sleekness of this website. The colour palette is simple and not overwhelming.</li>
                            <li>It is not as reactive as I think it could be. It felt a bit flat. The website could maybe be more reactive when I scroll down the screen.</li>
                            <li>The page is a bit busy. But overall, I like how the website looks.</li>
                        </ul> 
                <strong>Notes on my aesthetics and design elements</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>My aesthetic:
                        <ul>
                            <li>For this website I am going for a darker, more sleek style website, with a few whimsical elements (mostly just my illustration of myself). I find websites like these easier to read, and very aesthetically pleasing. I would also like to have my personality weaved within it in some way or form. This will be achieved with the illustration, but also through my writing. I write in a more casual style, and this is because I tend to be more relaxed when talking about things I enjoy, so, I want to carry the feeling over in my website.</li>
                            <li>I want the colour scheme to be simple and easily readable, and not too all over the place. It is very important to me to make sure that the colours on my website contrast, in order to make it easily readable for people who have eye problems (like me) as well as for people with colour blindness (several members of my family has this, and I have seen them struggle with this). I feel the colour scheme I have chosen contrasts enough for this to be possible. The colours I have chosen is black, white, mint green and forest green.</li>
                            <li>I have always like the sleeker, more simplistic style websites, so this is what I am going for, but with a few things that make it more whimsical (illustration and writing style).</li>
                            <li>I find that simpler websites with simple colour schemes, and that are not too busy, are easier to interact with. Websites that look busy are hard for me to read and interact with, so I want to avoid this with my website.</li>
                            <li>I also find websites that have darker backgrounds easier to read on, as it is not as heavy on my eyes. And considering that I have to work on this website a lot, I think making it easier for me to read as well as anyone who has the same issue, is important. Thus my background will be black.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Design elements
                        <ul>
                            <li>A navigation bar at the top of the screen that is always visible, even when you scroll down. This makes navigation very easy from where ever you are on the website, and the user does not have to go a long way around to get to where they need to be. This lowers the chance of them getting extremely frustrated in the long run.</li>
                            <li>Colours that clearly contrast in order to make reading the text on the pages easier. The colours I want to use are white, mint green, forest green and black. It is a good mix of light and dark, that contrasts against each other. These are simple colours but they can be used effectively in order to make certain elements on the page pop.</li>
                            <li>A limited colour palette, for the reasons given above.</li>
                            <li>When we get to CSS, I would like to add white space, in order to space the text more to the middle of the page, but still left aligned, in order to make it easier to read.</li>
                            <li>I am using the Helvetica font as it is easily readable, it does not have any frills that could be distracting or overwhelming and it can still look very professional.</li>
                            <li>All the interactable buttons on the page will have rounded corners, for two reasons. Reason one is because it is softer looking, which adds to more of a whimsical look. The second reason is for consistency. All the interactable buttons have rounded corners and everything else has sharp corners. This subtly shows the user that these elements are different.</li>
                            <li>The buttons that can be used have some sort of reactive element. In the navigaton bar and the blog navigation, the buttons change colour when you hover over it, and when you are on that page the colour of the button changes. The other buttons grow slightly and changes colour when the button is hovered over. This indicates to the user that these elements are interactable.</li>
                        </ul>
