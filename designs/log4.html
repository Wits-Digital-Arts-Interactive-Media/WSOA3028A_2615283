                            <td>Black, White, Mint Green, Forest Green (as shown in wireframes). This is partly because I like these colours, but also because I feel that these colours contrast each other enough for them to be visible at all times, and when used correctly, make important elements pop against the background. These colours are also contrasting enough, that if someone with colour blindness were to use the filtering available on browsers, they will still be able to see everything on the screen.</td>

Less importantly there will be the illustration of me that I drew, to add my personality into the website. I will not be adding any other images, as I think only the necessary images should be added, as not to make the use of bandwidth too extensive.</td>

When the user hovers over the buttons, they will change colour, as to indicate that it is clickable. </td>

I find reading on websites that have light backgrounds to be hard because it hurts my eyes, so I would like to prevent that for users using my website, andone way of doing that quite easily is to use a darker background.</td>

The positioning of multiple items on a page will be done in a symmetric way, as I find that to be aesthetically pleasing and easier to traverse. (There will be a few places where it will lean more to a assymetrical alignment, but only where relevant).</td>
