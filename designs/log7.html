                <h2>Implementation Documentation</h2>
                <h3>HTML:</h3>
                <p>The HTML that I am using is only for a few things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SEO
                        <ul>
                            <li>The meta tags help with this, through the title, the summary, robots, and so on.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Content
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the easiest way to showcase unique pieces of text, like blogs, essays, and so on.</li>
                            <li>It is the easiest way because the blog posts and essays are just text.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Containers
                        <ul>
                            <li>This helps me to add content through JavaScript, especially things that are repeatable, like blog post links or navigational links.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the micro-formatting, I try and be as descriptive as possible, to make it easier for me to keep track. They are also descriptive enough that most other people will also most likely know what I am trying to achieve. I did use standardised ones as far as I could, but it was not possible for everything I wanted to do. When it was something more unique, I used something that I would be able to understand when I go back to it.</p>
                <p>I am still not all that clear on which meta-tags are the best ones to use, but I tried to be consistent with them. I have the basic ones, but I added some more things to make it a bit more descriptive and useful in the long run.</p>
                <h3>CSS: </h3>
                <strong>Styling:</strong>
                <p>All the styling on the website is done through CSS, aside from a few places where I needed the text to be bold or emphasised, no matter the styling.</p>
                <p>I implemented the colours of the text and the background colour, as well as the colours for the buttons and the text blocks. The shapes of the elements have also been implemented through CSS, like the shapes of buttons and links.</p>
                <p>Some smaller things like link styling, font, font sizes, padding etc. have been implemented through CSS.</p>
                <strong>Animations:</strong>
                <p>I used CSS to implement the Animations instead of JavaScript, as I felt the CSS made it look smoother. I don't have too many animations. Just when the button hovers over interactable elements, the element grows in size, and goes back to its original size when the cursor is moved.</p>
                <p>I also have an arrow button on the homepage that moves when hovered over and is implemented through CSS.</p>
                <strong>Colour Transitions:</strong>
                <p>Wherever there is an interactable element, the colour of that element will change. When the mouse hovers over the element, along with the animation, the colour slowly transitions to a darker shade, indicating to the user that they can interact with this element. The animations and the colour transitions work together to communicate to the user that it can be interacted with.</p>
                <strong>Responsiveness:</strong>
                <p>I used CSS to make the website more responsive. I used media Queries to indicate to the website how the elements should change depending on the width of the screen. When the screen goes below a certain size, the navigation turns into a hamburger menu, and the elements on the page change size and position. This means that the website can be used on different screen sizes, making it a more responsive design.</p>
                <h3>JavaScript: </h3>          
                <strong>blogEntries, designEntries, essaysEntries, portfolioItems:</strong>      
                <p>These 4 scripts are all used for the same purpose. They create the indexes of the respective pages. I made this using the logic of the navigation menu but with a slightly different outcome and more attributes.</p>
                <p>With these scripts, I don't have to type out each entry with its link to have it in the index. I just need to give the script the relevant information, and it makes an index for me.</p>
                <strong>menu:</strong>
                <p>This is just the basic navigation script that we did when we first started using JavaScript. This is what I based a lot of my navigational elements on, as the logic made sense to me, and was something I could use in different places.</p>
                <strong>hamburger, smallMenu:</strong>
                <p>These are the two scripts I used to create a navigation menu for smaller screens. It took a bit of messing around, but it works. These scripts only really come into use when the screen is smaller. The menu has the same logic as the normal navigation menu, just formatted a little differently.</p>
                <strong>recentDesignLog, recentEssay, recentPortfolio, recentPost:</strong>
                <p>These are the four scripts that implement the link to the most recent post in the different sections. I again used a similar logic to that of my navigation menus, but it only utilizes the most recent data, instead of all of it.</p>
                <strong>footer:</strong>
                <p>This implements my social media links. The logic is simple, and it just prints the three links in an HTML element for me, so I don't have to write them out on each page.</p>
                <strong>randomFactAPI:</strong>
                <p>Knowing that I needed to implement an API, I wanted to do something fun. So, I found this Random Fact Generator API that prints a random fact when you call on it.</p>
                <p>The website with its information can be found at <a href ="https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/" target="_blank">https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/</a>. I would love to be able to provide a more fully fleshed-out reference with documentation, but I was not able to find any documentation, so I am only able to provide the link to the API.</p>
                <strong>Final Notes:</strong>
                <p>A lot of the things I have done here are most likely not optimised. I am sure there are much easier ways to do most of the things that I have done here. However, I am still learning, and I need to remember that as not to be too hard on myself. I have been able to make it more optimised over time, but it is nowhere near perfect yet. I am learning new things every time I work on this website, though, which I think is the important part.</p>
