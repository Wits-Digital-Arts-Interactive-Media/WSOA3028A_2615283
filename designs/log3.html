                    <strong>Initial Wireframes</strong>
                    <p>I prefer a more sleek looking website. I am not sure about a colour palette yet, but the following is what I basically imagine things to look like:</p>
    
                    <img src="images-in-designs/HomePage1Wireframe.PNG" alt="Home page wireframe - part 1. Shows that home page will contain an image (illustration) and basic information about Christine." title="Homepage part 1" width="640" height="360">

                    <strong>Page Block Outs</strong>
