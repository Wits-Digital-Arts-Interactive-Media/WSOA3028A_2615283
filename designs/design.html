                <h3>Inspriration:</h3>
                <p>I was looking for sleek websites that are easy to navigate and interesting to look at. I enjoy more sleek looking websites as they feel professional to me, and that is something I enjoy looking at and making. I looked at A LOT of websites, but these were the highlights for me:</p>
                            
                    <a href="https://gael-baurens.fr/">https://gael-baurens.fr/</a>
                            
                    <p>I really like the colour palette of this one. I also really like the way things slide in as you scroll down to look at the rest of the page.</p>
                            
                    <a href="https://gerlogu.com/">https://gerlogu.com/</a>
                            
                    <p>I like how alive this website feels. Everywhere you look, every time you scroll and everywhere you hover your mouse, something reacts.</p>
                            
                    <a href="https://www.jackbromhead.com/">https://www.jackbromhead.com/</a>
                            
                    <p>This one also caught my eye with the colour palette. I, however, do not like that the navigation on the top only takes you to a different place on the same page.</p>
                            
                    <a href="https://heathsmith.net/">https://heathsmith.net/</a>
                            
                    <p>This one I like because of the sleekness, and because of the colour palette, however, it is not as reactive as I would like. I would like there to be more reaction as I scroll or hover my mouse. It is also quite busy on a lot of the pages.</p>

                <p>I prefer a more sleek looking website. I am not sure about a colour palette yet, but the following is what I basically imagine things to look like:</p>
