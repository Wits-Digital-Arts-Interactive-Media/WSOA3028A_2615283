                <h3>Intent:</h3>
                <p>When playing a few cooperative multiplayer games, I found one mechanic that I found very
                    intriguing. The mechanic consisted of two characters being tied together by a rope of sort and
                    having to work together to achieve a certain goal, because they are tied together.</p>
                <p>Why did I find this mechanic to be so intriguing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is different to many multiplayer games I have played before, where you play
                        together, but you do your own thing.</li>
                    <li>This forces players to collaborate in their solutions to puzzles.</li>
                    <li>I have made many playable characters that walk on their own, I have never made two
                        playable characters that have to be attached to each other.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because I find this mechanic to be so interesting, I would like to try and replicate it in Unity.</p>
                <p>What would I like to achieve by replicating this mechanic:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have a Player Controller that can be used in local multiplayer games.</li>
                    <li>Find out how to tie two characters together and make this aspect work with movement
                        and jumping.</li>
                    <li>Figure out how to make it look like the two players are connected to each other.</li>
                    <li>Explore different ways this mechanic can be used.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                <p>In replicating this mechanic, I learned so many things. I learned things about Unity, as well as
                    about how to use certain functions in C#. I will be explaining what I learned through
                    evaluating whether I reached my goals for this prototype.</p>
                <p><strong>Have a player controller that can be used in local multiplayer games.</strong></p>
                <p>I now have a reusable Player Controller. This is something I will be able to use again, as well
                    as add to if there are any other actions that I would like my players to be able to do. I will be
                    able to use this Player Controller not only for local multiplayer games, but also for single
                    player games if I just comment out the second player’s code. I had coded the two players’
                    separately, so this would not be a problem.</p>
                <p><strong>Find out how to tie two characters together and make this aspect work with movement
                        and jumping.</strong></p>
                <p>This was quite the exploration while trying to figure out how to do this. The main thing I
                    learned about here was joints. I had never used them before, and when starting this
                    exploration, I only knew about the Hinge Joint. In excessive Googling, I found out about the
                    world of joints. There are so many types, and I tested all of them.</p>
                <p>From Distance Joints to Fixed Joints to Relative Joints. I finally settled on a Spring Joint.
                    This joint keeps the two objects a certain distance from each other, and when they exit this
                    distance, they bounce back like a spring. With a little bit of code and some adjustments to the
                    component, I was able to make a convincing rope, that only bounces a little bit.</p>
                <p>With the Spring Joint, the players can drag each other when moving, as well as when
                    jumping.</p>
                <p><strong>Figure out how to make it look like the two players are connected to each other.</strong></p>
                <p>This was another aspect that took me a while to figure out, but then I found line renderers.
                    This is also something I have never used before. I also had never heard of it before. This gave
                    me a simple way to illustrate that the two players are connected by a rope, without having to
                    mess with hinge joints that just gave me a lot of trouble.
                    It is not a dynamic, moving rope, but it does get the message across.</p>
                <p><strong>Explore different ways this mechanic can be used.</strong></p>
                <p>I did not make any drastic discoveries here; however, I did accidentally implement a crawling
                    aspect to the mechanic.</p>
                <p>When the players are grabbing onto a platform within the play area, they can move along this
                    platform by moving left or right. At first, I wanted to remove this, but I decided to leave it to
                    see what players would do with it.</p>
                <p>Players used this to their advantage, but also their detriment. It made new anchor points to
                    swing from, but it also complicated grabbing onto another platform.</p>
                <p>I found in playtesting that players seemed to enjoy this and feels like it adds to the mechanic.</p>
                <p><strong>Anything else that I learned:</strong></p>
                <p>I learned about the AddForce function in C#. I knew about this, but I was not sure how it
                    worked, and since my swinging was working (albeit a bit janky), I did not know if it was
                    necessary. However, one of the play testers \showed me how it works, and how simple it
                    actually is. I added it to my code, and it did wonders for the swinging aspect of the mechanic.
                    I am eternally grateful to them for showing me how it works, as I now have another thing in
                    my arsenal, and a better working mechanic and Player Controller.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, this prototype was a lot more valuable than I originally thought it would be. I
                    was not sure if replicating a mechanic that I liked would be the best approach for me, but I
                    was wrong. I learned so much through replicating this mechanic, and the things I learned are
                    things I will use in the future, and I am sure they will make my future endeavours a little
                    easier, even if it is by a minute amount. Every little bit counts. In the end I found a large
                    amount of value in doing this, and I will probably do something like this (replicating
                    mechanics I like) in the future.</p>
