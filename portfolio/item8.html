                <strong>Reflection:</strong>
                <p><em>How did it feel to redraft this piece?</em></p>
                <p>I received a lot of very valuable feedback on my previous draft, but it was quite stressful to
                    redraft this piece. I feel that this one might be better than the previous ones, as it makes a
                    little more sense, and the sequence of events flows better, but I am still very unsure of myself.
                    Starting this draft was one of the hardest parts, because I was not sure in which direction I
                    should have gone with this, be that another full overhaul, or something still similar to what it
                    was.</p>
                <p>I decided to do something in between the two, and I hope it is better than it was before.</p>
                <p>This draft was a little less enjoyable for me to do, if I am being honest, because it was tough
                    to know how much is too much, how much is too little, and are the changes I made even
                    better than what I had.</p>
                <p><em>What do you like most about your piece, why?</em></p>
                <p>The characters are my favourite part of this story. They have tension, and I hope I was able to
                    portray this properly. They play off each other quite well, and I think their story would be
                    cool to continue, even if it was in other situations, and not just the situation they are in
                    currently.</p>
                <p><em>What part of your piece needs the most improvement, why?</em></p>
                <p>I am still not sure if the structure is as good as it can be. I am struggling with y story beats
                    and how far apart exciting things need to be to make the story flow well. I want the story to
                    make sense, flow well, and read easily. I am not sure if I achieved this.</p>
                <p>I really hope this draft is better than the previous ones, as I oftem=n struggle to be able to see
                    whether I have improved or not.</p>

                    <summary><strong>Final Draft</strong></summary>
                    <p>Riley brushed off the final pieces of dirt from the skull. She lifted it into the light with a
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>“Jared, look at this! This is amazing!” Riley turned to him excitedly. Jared hummed from
                        where he was messing around in the corner. Riley rolled her eyes.</p>
                    <p>“So, Jared. What have you found?” Riley carefully placed the skull back down. He hummed
                        again. She looked over at what he was doing. He was smacking at a loose rock in the wall
                        with his walking stick. Riley sighed deeply.</p>
                    <p>She was about to go back to the skull when a crack echoed through the cave.</p>
                    <p>Jared froze. They were quiet.</p>
                    <p>The rock he was hitting fell to the floor, right next to where a massive crack in the floor just
                        formed.</p>
                    <p>“Riley, I think we need to-” Jared was cut off by the crack in the floor spreading to the wall.</p>
                    <p>Jared carefully walked over to the table and grabbed the torch. He tip-toed towards Riley who
                        was staring at the floor with wide eyes. She slowly stood from her position on the floor,
                        trying not to move too much.</p>
                    <p>Then the roof cracked. It started to cave in.</p>
                    <p>Jared grabbed Riley’s arm and pulled her towards the exit. She momentarily looked at the
                        skull she left on the floor before a boulder crushed it from above. Her whole body cringed, a
                        surprised sound escaping her mouth.</p>
                    <p>“Riley, there will be more skulls and more caves, but only if we get out of here,” Jared
                        yanked her in front of him, pushing her forward. “<em>Run.</em>”</p>
                    <p>Riley took off down the cave system, deciding to mourn her discovery later. She clumsily
                        grabbed at her belt for her radio. The cave was coming down behind them at an alarming
                        speed.</p>
                    <p>“Sam, are you there? The cave is collapsing!” Riley yelled into the radio. No answer. “Sam,
                        please tell me you can hear me.” Still nothing.</p>
                    <p>“F**k!” Jared screamed. Riley stopped in her tracks, spinning around. The roof had collapsed
                        right above him, catching his leg. She rushed back towards him.</p>
                    <p>“Riley, go! Find help!” he yelled. She ignored him, pushing at the boulder that pinned his leg
                        to the floor. After some struggle, she got it off and pulled him to his feet. He stood, careful
                        not to put weight on his pounding leg. She knew there was no way they were running
                        anywhere now.</p>
                    <p>There had to be somewhere they could go. She flicked her eyes all over the walls. The cave
                        was starting to crumble from all sides.</p>
                    <p>Her eyes caught on a small archway to the left that seemed to be stable. That was their only
                        chance. She started to drag Jared towards it. He looked at her, confusion and pain covering
                        his face.</p>
                    <p>“What are you-” Jared started, his voice strained.</p>
                    <p>“Just move.” Riley strained. They hobbled towards the small entrance, and she pushed him in
                        front of her just as the roof caved in behind them. She fell to her knees, small stones digging
                        into her skin.</p>
                    <p>They breathed deeply as everything went silent.</p>
                    <p>She rolled onto her back, closing her eyes. She swallowed, trying not to cough from the dust
                        covering her face.</p>
                    <p>Jared grunted next to her. She looked over. He was looking down at his bleeding leg, his face
                        pulled into a grimace.</p>
                    <p>Riley took another deep breath before sitting up and turning towards him. She looked down at
                        his leg. Most of the skin on the outside of his leg was gone, and blood was dripping onto the
                        floor.</p>
                    <p>Trying not to faint at the sight, Riley looked around. They had very little with them. There
                        was one torch and two radios. She grabbed a radio.</p>
                    <p>“Sam, we’re stuck in a small cave somewhere in the system. Jared’s hurt.” No answer. She
                        gripped the radio harder. “Please, can anyone hear me?” No answer. She was desperately
                        holding back tears.</p>
                    <p>She took a deep breath and looked back at Jared’s leg. They needed to wrap it somehow. She
                        looked down at the shirt that was too big for her anyway. Grabbing at the bottom, she ripped
                        off the bottom half.</p>
                    <p>“What are you doing?” Jared asked, his voice strained. She ignored him.</p>
                    <p>She started wrapping the cloth around his leg. He groaned and pulled his leg back.</p>
                    <p>“Sit still.” She hissed. Stopping, she took a deep breath. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to- Sorry.”</p>
                    <p>He just nodded, clenching his teeth as she finished wrapping the already bloodied cloth
                        around his leg.</p>
                    <p>She sits back, wiping her blood-covered hands on her pants. She looked around at all the
                        walls. They were stuck. There was no way out. Panic started to rise in her chest. Maybe her
                        mom was right. She dragged her hands over her face, smearing blood and dust down her
                        cheeks. Maybe she should not have become an archaeologist. Maybe she should have just
                        become an accountant like her mom said-</p>
                    <p>“Are you okay?” Jared asked. “I mean, obviously not, we are stuck in a cave, but still.”</p>
                    <p>She quickly wiped the tears from her cheeks, nodding.</p>
                    <p>“You know you can talk to me.” Jared continued. Riley laughed humourlessly. He looked
                        offended. “What are you laughing at?” Riley just shook her head.</p>
                    <p>“Okay, fine, sorry I’m not Sam. Sorry that your boyfriend was too scared to come in with
                        us.” He crossed his arms and turned his head away from her, rolling his eyes.</p>
                    <p>“He is not my boyfriend!” she slammed her hands against the floor making the dust puff into
                        the air. “How many times do I have to tell you?! We are just lab partners!”</p>
                    <p>“Oh please, he is practically begging you to date him.” Jared shook his head, pulling his arms
                        closer towards his chest.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know what your problem is with him! He is a nice guy!” she threw her hands up into
                        the air. “Why are you so- so- so jealous?!” Riley exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>“I am not- I-” his mouth opened and closed a few times. “I am not jealous! I am just- just
                        making an observation.” He shrugged his shoulders. “If you are too- too blind to see that he
                        prays to the ground you walk on, that- that is- that’s on you.” He pulled his chin closer to his
                        chest.</p>
                    <p>Riley frowned, turning her body away from him. Jared sighed. This was not what he was
                        trying to achieve.</p>
                    <p>“I’m sorry. I- sorry.” He said softly.</p>
                    <p>They sat in silence for a while.</p>
                    <p>“I fought with my mom before we came here,” Riley started softly. “I said some things I did
                        not mean. Now I am going to die here with my mom hating my guts.”</p>
                    <p>Her eyes filled back up with tears. Jared looked at her, unsure about what to say.</p>
                    <p>“What did you- what did you fight about?”</p>
                    <p>“About me being an archaeologist. All our fights are about that.” Riley scoffed. “She thinks I
                        won’t get a husband being an archaeologist.”</p>
                    <p>“But you’re happy in this job, aren’t you?” Jared looked confused.</p>
                    <p>“Yeah, but she doesn’t care.” Riley pushed her head into her elbows. “I don’t agree with her,
                        but I don’t want her to hate me. She’s still my mom.”</p>
                    <p>Jared nodded, unsure what to say.</p>
                    <p>“I was hoping this expedition would be successful,” Riley said, her throat tightening. “I was
                        hoping to prove her wrong.”</p>
                    <p>Neither of them said anything for a while.</p>
                    <p>“I’m sure we will get out of here. I’m sure Sam is doing everything he can to find us. And
                        I’m sure your mom will just be happy you’re safe.” He spoke. He looked at Riley, his eyes
                        full of hope.</p>
                    <p>She chuckled. He didn’t hear any humour in her laugh.</p>
                    <p>“That’s doubtful.” She said softly.</p>
                    <p>He wasn’t sure which part of his statement she doubted.</p>
                    <p>Not knowing what to do. They sat, and they waited. Until there was a crackling sound
                        coming from the radios on the floor.</p>
                    <p>“Riley? Jared? Can you hear me?” It was Sam. Riley’s heart pounded in her ears as she
                        grabbed for the radio.</p>
                    <p>“Sam! Sam, thank goodness.” A smile stretched over her face. “We can hear you, yes!”</p>
                    <p>“We are working to remove some of the rubble. We are going to get you out.”</p>
