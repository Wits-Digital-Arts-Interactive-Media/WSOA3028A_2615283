                <strong>Reflection:</strong>
                <p><em>How did it feel to redraft this piece?</em></p>
                <p>I was surprised by the amount of time I struggled with redrafting this piece. It is so short, but
                    I really needed to bog down and properly think about how I am going to redraft it so every
                    word is used effectively. I was not struggling with keeping it within the character limit like I
                    thought I would, but I did struggle with which words to use so everything still makes sense
                    and so a story still emerges from this piece, even though it is so short.</p>
                <p>I did, however, enjoy redrafting this one the most. I really enjoyed the micro-fiction task. It
                    isn’t an easy task, but it is fun and is something I would like to do more often.</p>
                <p><em>What do you like most about your piece, why?</em></p>
                <p>I enjoy that it is punchy. I feel like there is feeling and tension in each sentence. It is short but
                    it tells a story, and I feel as if it gives a good indication of what the world of the story looks
                    like at that moment in time.</p>
                <p><em>What part of your piece needs the most improvement, why?</em></p>
                <p>I feel as if there might still be parts that are unnecessary or could have been stated differently.
                    The part where the character crashes into the shack still feels weird. I did not know which
                    word to use, or whether the sentence was even necessary, but it felt like it needed to be there,
                    so I left it in.</p>
                <p>Also, the second paragraph, I am still not sure if I should have stated that differently. I went
                    through, like, seven different ways to write that sentence, and settled on ‘She has to run’, but
                    I am still not sure whether it feels right.</p>

                    <p>Her heartbeat thumps in her ears. Pain shoots down her legs.</p>
                    <p>She has to run.</p>
                    <p>Sweat streaks down her dusty face. Her throat burns.</p>
                    <p><em>Run.</em></p>
                    <p>She crashes into a crumbling shack. Her breathing loud.</p>
                    <p>She looks up. UFOs everywhere.</p>
                    <p>The conspiracies were right.</p>
                    <p>Aliens do exist.</p>
