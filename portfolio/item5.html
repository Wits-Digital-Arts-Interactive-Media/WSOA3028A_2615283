                <strong>Reflection:</strong>
                <p><em>How did it feel to redraft this piece?</em></p>
                <p>This last draft was quite hard for me to do. I was struggling with the possibility that it would
                    come out much worse than the previous one. I went back and really thought about if the
                    sequence of events made sense in the previous drafts and I tried to improve upon it. I tried to
                    apply a structure to it more strictly, more than I had in the previous drafts.</p>
                <p>I think the part that was hardest for me was to go out of my comfort zone and make more
                    drastic changes, because it was a ‘final’ draft that I needed to hand in. I did make more
                    drastic changes than I was comfortable doing, because the previous draft just did not feel
                    right, but I am still unsure whether it was actually worth it.</p>
                <p>I do feel a bit better about this story after this redraft though, because even though I do not
                    think it is perfect yet, I do think it has improved, even if it was just a little.</p>
                <p><em>What do you like most about your piece, why?</em></p>
                <p>In this version I like that Jordan felt more human. I think she became more human over the
                    course of the last few drafts. I know her better now, than I did at the beginning (The character
                    sketch I did on a piece of paper really helped with that). She is an interesting person with
                    flaws and quirks, and she has a coffee addiction, which is relatable (except I have a Monster
                    addiction...)</p>
                <p><em>What part of your piece needs the most improvement, why?</em></p>
                <p>I think the structure of the story still needs work. I found it hard to apply a structure to the
                    story in a strict manner because it is such a short piece. I really need to look deeper into story
                    structures and which would work best for me. I get way too excited when writing stories and
                    sometimes forget that it needs to be structured properly and they need to make sense, and
                    then when I go back to it, it is all over the place, and I have a panic session.</p>
                <p>I think my biggest problem lies with the fact that I am never sure where my story beats lie
                    and how to determine where the best places for important story beats are.</p>

                    <summary><strong>Final Draft</strong></summary>
                    <p>Her hands burned holding her third cup of coffee. She stared at the photo on the wall from
                        where she sat. The last photo she took with her family. It taunted her. Her phone sat on the
                        table in front of her, the screen displayed the call logs listing her father’s missed calls. She
                        hasn’t heard from her family in years, not to mention her dad. Why now, she didn’t know.</p>
                    <p>She startled at a knock on her door. Her heart jumped in her chest as she sat down her cup.
                        Not expecting anyone this early in the morning, she carefully approached the door and looked
                        through the peep hole.</p>
                    <p>She sighed in relief when she saw John the mailman.</p>
                    <p>“You scared the shit out of me.” she said with a small grin. John looked amused.</p>
                    <p>Thanking him for the letters, she locked the door behind him. She leafed through the mail on
                        her walk back to the dining room. Bill. Bill. Advertisement. Bill. Legal letter. Bill-</p>
                    <p>Legal letter?</p>
                    <p>She dropped the bills on the table, ignoring the splash when they hit the coffee cup. Reading
                        the sender’s address, she vaguely recognised the law firm it was from. She ripped opened the
                        envelope, cautiously opening the letter inside.</p>
                    <p><em>Jordan,</em></p>
                    <p><em>I regret to inform you that your mother passed on Monday morning.</em></p>
                    <p>Her throat tightened.</p>
                    <p><em>She asked me to contact you when she did. She asked me to tell you she believed you. She was
                        just scared.</em></p>
                    <p>Tears dropped onto the page. Ink veined on the page.</p>
                    <p><em>I have attached her will to this letter. I thought you would like to know what she left you.</em></p>
                    <p><em>I’m sorry for your loss.</em></p>
                    <p><em>Daniel</em></p>
                    <p>A familiar voice came through the door just as she reached the end of the letter. Her head
                        spun towards it.</p>
                    <p>“Jordan! We need to talk.” It was her father.</p>
                    <p>She heard people talking outside, whispering to each other. Her eyes flicked back to the letter. She grabbed at it, looking for the attached will.</p>
                    <p><em>I give the totality of my estate, which in value equates to R 25 000 000.00, to my daughter
                        Jordan Edwards.</em></p>
                    <p>Her eyes widened. She heard her father starting to bang on the door.</p>
                    <p>“Mom what have you done?” she whispered.</p>
