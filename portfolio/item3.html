                <h3>Intent:</h3>
                <p>In looking at the GDC Europe video (Juice It or Lose It) with speakers Martin Jonasson
                    and Petri Purho (2012), the Art of Screen Shake video by Dutch Game Garden with
                    speaker Jan Willem Nijman (2013) and the Anatomy of a Successful Attack by Ben Ruiz
                    and Matthew Wegner (2015), I decided I want to learn how to implement feedback
                    elements in a certain game type.
                    The game type I chose is a platformer… because I like platformers ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
                    In doing this, I hope to learn how to make my games juicier.</p>
                <p><strong>What do I mean by wanting to learn how to implement these elements?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I do not know how to apply screen shake.</li>
                    <li>I suck at particle systems and making them look like something.</li>
                    <li>How to use sound effects effectively escapes me and honestly terrifies me (also,
                        which sound effects to use).</li>
                    <li>I do not know how to add small movements to items in the game to make them
                        more alive.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What do I mean by juicy?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In simple terms, reactive.</li>
                    <li>I want the simulation to do something when the player interacts with it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What do I want to explore?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As mentioned before, there is a list of feedback elements I do not know how to
                        implement, and I would like to learn how to implement them.
                        <ul>
                            <li>I do not want to spend several prototypes on this, so I thought the best
                                course of action would be to shove it all into one prototype.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>I think it might be useful to have a place where I have explored these different
                        aspects and a place I can refer back to when I want to implement these aspects
                        again.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Reflection on Playtesting:</h3>
                <p>I found it interesting that all the players picked up on different things that bothered
                    them. A lot of them I think is preference, but I still think it is worth going back and
                    adjusting the elements they mention. I agree with a lot of what they said as well, there
                    are things I could have done better, and things I missed, and I think these tests were
                    valuable in showing me more clearly what these things are.</p>
                <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                <p>This prototype was more on the simple side of things I could have done. However, I
                    enjoyed making this prototype immensely. Not only did I learn a lot, but I could see the
                    things I learned come to fruition.</p>
                <p>Most of what I learned is mentioned above in the process part of this document, so I will
                    try not to repeat myself too much in this reflection part.</p>
                <p>I found that making this prototype was extremely valuable. I learned more about certain
                    feedback elements I knew a little about, and I also learned how to implement
                    completely new elements (like screen shake for example).</p>
                <p>The one thing that surprised me the most was in implementing the sound effects. I was
                    convinced that it would be a lot harder, and I had an irrational fear when it came to
                    implementing sound effects, because I was scared the sound effects would not fit with
                    each other or make no sense.</p>
                <p>However, when I actually sat down, and made an effort to look for sound effects that
                    would work for my prototype and communicate what I was trying to achieve, I found that
                    it was not THAT hard, and that it could be quite enjoyable. And after learning about a few
                    tips and tricks to use when using sound, I flew through all the sound effects, and the
                    ones I chose seemed to fit quite well, especially after making some adjustments to
                    volume and pitch.</p>
                <p>The sound was one of the easier parts that I implemented, but it was the part I had the
                    most revelations in.</p>
                <p>With the particle systems, I already knew a little bit, but I always dreaded using them,
                    because I struggled to use them in a way that made them look right. But after doing
                    some research and fiddling a little bit, I found that they could be quite useful and
                    enjoyable to make. I definitely built up some confidence when it comes to the particle
                    systems, and I am quite grateful for that.</p>
                <p>The animations I still want to smack with a hammer to make me feel better about it,
                    because even after struggling for a few hours, I still could not get some of it to work. That
                    is something I will need to go back to and figure out properly in the future.</p>
                <p>All in all, this was quite an enriching experience. I now have a bunch of code I can come
                    back to and use in the future when working with feedback. I know this is going to make
                    me sigh a breath of relief in the future, as this will make my life a lot easier when making
                    games. Anything I can use again, and not have to code again is a positive in my book.</p>
