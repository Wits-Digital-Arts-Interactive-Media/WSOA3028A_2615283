                <h3>Intent:</h3>
                <p>I want to be able to use physics in Unity to build my prototype. However, the physics system
                    in Unity I find difficult to understand. Thus, I want to attempt to build a simple system that
                    simulates physics. To do this, I want to create a mechanic where an object is elevated and
                    lowered by adding objects that can incrementally lift and drop the object depending on the
                    added element.</p>
                <p>Why do I find the Physics system difficult to understand?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are several elements in the physics components in the editor itself, that I do not
                        understand, either because I do not know how they work, or the terminology used to
                        describe them is not intuitive to me. Some terms for example, Linear drag, angular
                        drag, max linear correction, max angular correction, Baumgarte scale, sleep
                        tolerance., etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There were two ways I thought of to approach the above problem. Either I learn how to use
                    the system (which is intimidating), or I "fake" it in a sense, by using elements in the editor
                    that I do understand, as well as code I do understand. The latter is what I am attempting to do.</p>
                <p>How will I be using the mechanic to attempt to do this?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>By using the Unity grid that is visible in Unity2D as a large graph.</li>
                    <li>By using the object’s position on the graph to determine where it is in the space I am
                        building, and then simulate floating and falling using vectors in code.</li>
                    <li>By using different elements (balloons, weights, parachutes, etc.) to lift the object,
                        lower the object or slow the object’s descent.
                        <ul>
                            <li>These elements will all have certain properties in their code to achieve this.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                <p>While making this prototype I was able to ‘fake’ the physics – build my own physics system
                    – to a certain point. What I mean by this is that I could take certain elements and make them
                    work similarly to what I think Unity Physics would be able to do, just in code, but after a
                    certain point, it does not come off as realistic anymore.</p>
                <p>This is something that became obvious to me when I had the prototype play tested a few
                    times by some of my peers. One of the glaring problems I had was making it look like the
                    character was floating up and not just going up in position. I got an effect that was close, by
                    slowly moving the character up when they were lifted by the balloon and drop faster when
                    they are holding a weight.</p>
                <p>Something the players noted (and this is something I had realised as well), is that the fact that
                    the character goes up or down a consistent amount, makes it feel unrealistic. I was struggling
                    with this, as at first. In my head that is how it would work, and I do not think this is
                    necessarily wrong, but I think if I had found a way to implement it differently, it would have
                    come across more realistic. Maybe by making the character ‘look’ floatier. I could approach
                    this through animations, or even use the code I already have to make the character slightly
                    move up and down as they move along.</p>
                <p>So, when referring to the physics itself, I think it was successful to an extent. The ‘gravity’
                    works; the character falls when there is no balloon attached or when it walks off a platform,
                    even though there is no gravity attached to it in Unity. The character ‘floats’ or goes up when
                    a floating device is added and goes down when the character’s weight is increased. However,
                    it does not feel realistic. It does not feel as if the character has any weight to it. It feels like
                    the character is an image that is changing positions on a graph. Which is what it is doing, but
                    I was trying to make it look like it was using realistic physics, and I do not feel as if this was
                    all that successful.</p>
                <p>If I were to go back, I would have looked at the following to make changes to, as to make it
                    look more realistic in movement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I would test implementing what Player 2 had mentioned in the playtest below; to
                        decrease the speed that the character is moving at over time when it floats up.</li>
                    <li>I would experiment with giving the character itself weight, and see how that would
                        change things, and if that would make it more realistic.
                        <ul>
                            <li>I would probably make a change in how I approached the problem of
                                movement (vertical and horizontal) completely. I would have to do more
                                research on this.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>I would go back to the code used in the prototype to see if there was anything I could
                        do differently or change to have make it look more realistic in game and make it
                        easier to adjust if needed.</li>
                    <li>I would put more time into the graphics, in the sense that I think some of my above
                        problems could be remedied by adding some small animations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Moving on to the other aspect I ended up also testing, the graphics. I was trying to use
                    graphics to solidify the feeling and intent of the physics system.</p>
                <p>In my first prototype, I only used iconography. I made it look like one balloon when one
                    balloon was used, and made it look like many balloons when there was more. I was surprised
                    to see how effective the iconography ended up being. The players almost immediately knew
                    what each element was supposed to do, and they said that when the graphic elements were
                    added, it did clearly communicate what the element was supposed to do.</p>
                <p>In the second prototype, instead of using graphics that showed more balloons when more
                    balloons were used, I used colours on the balloons to indicate something similar. The colours
                    were changing as the lifting force got stronger. So, instead of many balloons, it was a stronger
                    balloon, and this was indicated by the balloon getting redder as it got stronger. I made the
                    prototype with the coloured balloons to evaluate a separate way of indicating the same thing,
                    because maybe I would be surprised, and it would work better than just the graphics. I was,
                    however, not surprised when this ended up being less effective than the iconography.</p>
                <p>The comment I got the most was that it was not clear what it was indicating, and the colour
                    palette change was jarring. So, in the prototype I submitted, I opted for just submitting the
                    first one with just the graphics, as the colours just did not land at all.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, I think it is possible for me to fake physics, or make my own physics system,
                    but it is something I would have to work on further. The system I built is not where it should
                    or can be and needs a lot more work. The basics are there, which is helpful, and I learned a lot
                    about how it is possible to go around set systems in Unity and go down your own path.
                    However, it was not as successful as I hoped it would be. I do not think it is a lost cause, and
                    with some work, I might be able to have a system that would mean I never have to use Unity
                    physics again, but for now, I do not have this magical system that I not only understand but
                    achieves the same look and feel that Unity physics gives.</p>
                <p>But I did learn, however, that art in games does not have to be all that complicated.
                    Sometimes simple iconography works and communicates the same thing that complex art
                    does. Using only icons could even make a game that is fun and interesting to look at. Now, I
                    do not think my art in this prototype is perfect. I think if there were a few animations when
                    the character walked, or floated, or fell, it would look even more alive. For what I set out to
                    do with the art in the prototype, however, I think it was successful, and I had fun making it.</p>
                <p>Further expansion on how I approached my prototyping as well as my findings can be found
                    below.</p>
                <h3>What I did:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I started by writing down my idea for the mechanic and sketching some designs so I
                        could see what I was aiming for. This enabled me to visualise what I wanted to do
                        before jumping in and making the prototype.</li>
                    <li>I then set aside around 3 hours to work on an initial prototype so I can see what it
                        would look like and whether this would even work. I was keeping the article we read
                        for the first week, How to Prototype a Game in Under 7 Days (Kucic, 2005), as well
                        as what was said in class, so I was trying my hand at pushing out a prototype in a
                        really short period of time as to not lose too much work if it didn’t work.</li>
                    <li>After the three hours I had three levels showing the three elements I mention above;
                        doing what I wanted them to do for the most part. The code at this point is messy and
                        all over the place, and it still needed work.</li>
                    <li>I had added some simple graphics to the game so what is happing within the prototype
                        is also showcased in the graphics.</li>
                    <li>I then went back into the code to clean it up, make it simpler and easier for me to
                        understand (especially if I were to come back to it in the future).</li>
                    <li>The first version used too many game objects to achieve the floating and falling
                        effects.</li>
                    <li>The character itself had gravity on it in the rigid body, meaning that it was falling
                        when it should not have and not floating in the manner, I wanted it to. So, I tried to fix
                        this by adding the squares, and adding the floating and falling code to the square,
                        which did not use gravity.</li>
                    <li>I went back into unity, removed the squares, and just took off the gravity on the
                        character itself. After doing this, the character was moving the way I wanted it too
                        originally.</li>
                    <li>The code is a lot neater than it was before, and the movement of the character is
                        smoother.</li>
                    <li>After this, I started balancing the numbers of different elements on each object
                        (balloon, parachute, etc.). The elements consist of the weight of the object (whether
                        the object is lighter and will lift the character, or heavier, dropping the character), as
                        well as speed (how the object effects the speed the character is moving in the
                        horizontal direction).</li>
                    <li>The code could still use some work, I think there is still a lot to be improved, as I do
                        not think where it is at now is the most effective or flexible for what I need it to do,
                        but for now it works as it is.</li>
                    <li>Some terms to be found in the spread sheets:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Weight: This is what indicates how much the character floats up and how
                                much the character lowers, depending on the element that is added.</li>
                            <li>Speed: This is how much the element effects the speed of the character
                                moving upwards or downwards.</li>
                            <li>Hinderance to movement: how much an element hinders the horizontal
                                movement of the character. For example, the weight that makes the character
                                move slower when it goes left or right.</li>
                            <li>Base speed of Character: the speed of the character moving horizontally when
                                no element is added.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>After working on the code, I started thinking about how I can communicate the
                        character’s movement and how they are moving in other ways, other than just the
                        speed the character is moving at.</li>
                    <li>The first thing I decided was to go with iconography as my graphics in the prototype.
                        I did this because it is easy to produce quickly and change if necessary. I did not feel
                        like the prototype needed complicated art, as it is just that, a prototype, but it did need
                        graphics that still clearly communicated what each element was doing. This is
                        achievable with simple shapes if you do it right.</li>
                    <li>I decided to concentrate on the balloons in following testing, as they have the most
                        effect on the movement in this prototype.</li>
                    <li>I thought of two ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Graphics showing the amount and size of the balloons lifting the character.</li>
                            <li>Distinct colours of the balloons indicating how far up they are taking the
                                character.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>I asked a few people to playtest the two different prototypes and asked them a few
                        questions about the graphics and the movement in the prototype.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Playtests:</h3>
                <p>I asked three people to playtest the game. I asked them questions about the mechanic itself, as
                    well as the two types of graphics used. The answers below are paraphrased from what they
                    told me when I asked them the questions.</p>
                <h4>Player 1:</h4>
                <p><strong>Was the amount of information given enough for you to figure out what you had to do?
                    Why or why not?</strong></p>
                <p>This player made it clear that the UI elements were both intuitive and not intuitive. There is
                    no indication of where to go in each level. They suggested indicating a goal.</p>
                <p><strong>Was the graphics from prototype one or two better at communicating the effect of each
                    element on the character?</strong></p>
                <p>The parachute was not as clear in the first two levels as it was not necessary to use it. They
                    suggested making a level with just the parachute in use. The balloons, however, were clear in
                    the first prototype. They showed what they were supposed to achieve, and how quickly or
                    how much. The second prototype with the colours, however, did not convey the same
                    information as effectively. They feel that the prototype with just the graphics is better.</p>
                <p><strong>Does the character feel light when it needs to feel light and heavy when it needs to feel
                    heavy? Why or why not?</strong></p>
                <p>The character does not really 'feel' lighter or heavier. It is just moving up and down according
                    to the 'weight' of the elements used. Something that could remedy this, is to make the
                    character move slower in the horizontal direction as well, when they are carrying weight or
                    using the parachute.</p>
                <p><strong>Is there anything you would have approached differently? What and how?</strong></p>
                <p>Would have done something to make it feel 'heavier'. Examples, the character comes down
                    faster, the character moves slower when walking if they hold a weight. Another thing would
                    be to change the position of the graphics of the balloons, so it is clearer when more than one
                    balloon type is used.</p>
                <p>After this first playtest, I made a few small adjustments before the following playtests.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I adjusted some of the numbers in the code that adjusted the speeds and weights.</li>
                    <li>I added a variable that slows the movement of the character when moving
                        horizontally if the character is carrying weights.</li>
                    <li>And organised the UI elements in a different manner.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Player 2:</h4>
                <p><strong>Was the amount of information given enough for you to figure out what you had to do?
                    Why or why not?</strong></p>
                <p>This player said that the balloons made it obvious what the goal of the element was but did
                    not feel the same about the weight and the big ballon. They felt that these were not as clear in
                    their intentions as they had no indication of how many are being used.</p>
                <p><strong>Was the graphics from prototype one or two better at communicating the effect of each
                    element on the character?</strong></p>
                <p>They felt as if the way the graphics in the first prototype were remarkably effective. The
                    balloons with the stretched-out strings made it look like a helium balloon that is supposed to
                    be lifting something. To them this came instinctually. The prototype with the colours was less
                    clear. They understood that the higher the balloons went, the colour changed, however, this
                    was not clear. They expressed that this would probably not be clear without further indication
                    as to what it is supposed to mean. They also felt that the colour in the second prototype was
                    jarring, compared to the first one where all the graphics were unified, as they were colourless
                    and just icons.</p>
                <p><strong>Does the character feel light when it needs to feel light and heavy when it needs to feel
                    heavy? Why or why not?</strong></p>
                <p>The weight of the character feels constant as opposed to floaty or like it was falling. It feels
                    universal as the character moves up and down certain amounts, and it does not really show
                    how gravity effects the objects in the way people would expect. It does not feel realistic in
                    that sense.</p>
                <p><strong>Is there anything you would have approached differently? What and how?</strong></p>
                <p>This player would change the way the character moves up. It would start going up at a certain
                    speed, and then slowly decelerate as the character approaches the goal height.</p>
                <p>This playtest brought forth a few good suggestions, that if I had more time to spend on the
                    prototype, I would have tried my best to implements it. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maybe having the speed that the character floats up at decrease over time.</li>
                    <li>This might make it feel a bit more realistic.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Player 3:</h4>
                <p><strong>Was the amount of information given enough for you to figure out what you had to do?
                    Why or why not?</strong></p>
                <p>This player said that the intentions of the prototype and the goal of the level was clear to
                    them, possibly because they are someone who plays games on a regular. However, if it was
                    someone who does not play games often, they might not find it intuitive.</p>
                <p><strong>Was the graphics from prototype one or two better at communicating the effect of each
                    element on the character?</strong></p>
                <p>They felt that there was an unclear limit to how many balloons can be used, as the graphics
                    for four balloons and the graphics for more balloons is the same. After playing around it
                    became clear that there is no limit, but this was not clear from the beginning. The colour
                    prototype made no sense however, and they preferred the first prototype with just the
                    graphics.</p>
                <p><strong>Does the character feel light when it needs to feel light and heavy when it needs to feel
                    heavy? Why or why not?</strong></p>
                <p>It feels like the character is moving up and down in 'layers'. At a consistent amount. It does
                    not feel floaty like a balloon should.</p>
                <p><strong>Is there anything you would have approached differently? What and how?</strong></p>
                <p>There was not anything the player felt they would have done differently at this point.</p>
