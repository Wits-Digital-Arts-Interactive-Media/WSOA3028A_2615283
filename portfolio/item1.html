                <h3>Intent:</h3>
                <p>I want to be able to use physics in Unity to build my prototype. However, the physics system
                    in Unity I find difficult to understand. Thus, I want to attempt to build a simple system that
                    simulates physics. To do this, I want to create a mechanic where an object is elevated and
                    lowered by adding objects that can incrementally lift and drop the object depending on the
                    added element.</p>
                <p>Why do I find the Physics system difficult to understand?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are several elements in the physics components in the editor itself, that I do not
                        understand, either because I do not know how they work, or the terminology used to
                        describe them is not intuitive to me. Some terms for example, Linear drag, angular
                        drag, max linear correction, max angular correction, Baumgarte scale, sleep
                        tolerance., etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There were two ways I thought of to approach the above problem. Either I learn how to use
                    the system (which is intimidating), or I "fake" it in a sense, by using elements in the editor
                    that I do understand, as well as code I do understand. The latter is what I am attempting to do.</p>
                <p>How will I be using the mechanic to attempt to do this?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>By using the Unity grid that is visible in Unity2D as a large graph.</li>
                    <li>By using the object’s position on the graph to determine where it is in the space I am
                        building, and then simulate floating and falling using vectors in code.</li>
                    <li>By using different elements (balloons, weights, parachutes, etc.) to lift the object,
                        lower the object or slow the object’s descent.
                        <ul>
                            <li>These elements will all have certain properties in their code to achieve this.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                <p>While making this prototype I was able to ‘fake’ the physics – build my own physics system
                    – to a certain point. What I mean by this is that I could take certain elements and make them
                    work similarly to what I think Unity Physics would be able to do, just in code, but after a
                    certain point, it does not come off as realistic anymore.</p>
                <p>This is something that became obvious to me when I had the prototype play tested a few
                    times by some of my peers. One of the glaring problems I had was making it look like the
                    character was floating up and not just going up in position. I got an effect that was close, by
                    slowly moving the character up when they were lifted by the balloon and drop faster when
                    they are holding a weight.</p>
                <p>Something the players noted (and this is something I had realised as well), is that the fact that
                    the character goes up or down a consistent amount, makes it feel unrealistic. I was struggling
                    with this, as at first. In my head that is how it would work, and I do not think this is
                    necessarily wrong, but I think if I had found a way to implement it differently, it would have
                    come across more realistic. Maybe by making the character ‘look’ floatier. I could approach
                    this through animations, or even use the code I already have to make the character slightly
                    move up and down as they move along.</p>
                <p>So, when referring to the physics itself, I think it was successful to an extent. The ‘gravity’
                    works; the character falls when there is no balloon attached or when it walks off a platform,
                    even though there is no gravity attached to it in Unity. The character ‘floats’ or goes up when
                    a floating device is added and goes down when the character’s weight is increased. However,
                    it does not feel realistic. It does not feel as if the character has any weight to it. It feels like
                    the character is an image that is changing positions on a graph. Which is what it is doing, but
                    I was trying to make it look like it was using realistic physics, and I do not feel as if this was
                    all that successful.</p>
                <p>If I were to go back, I would have looked at the following to make changes to, as to make it
                    look more realistic in movement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I would test implementing what Player 2 had mentioned in the playtest below; to
                        decrease the speed that the character is moving at over time when it floats up.</li>
                    <li>I would experiment with giving the character itself weight, and see how that would
                        change things, and if that would make it more realistic.
                        <ul>
                            <li>I would probably make a change in how I approached the problem of
                                movement (vertical and horizontal) completely. I would have to do more
                                research on this.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>I would go back to the code used in the prototype to see if there was anything I could
                        do differently or change to have make it look more realistic in game and make it
                        easier to adjust if needed.</li>
                    <li>I would put more time into the graphics, in the sense that I think some of my above
                        problems could be remedied by adding some small animations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Moving on to the other aspect I ended up also testing, the graphics. I was trying to use
                    graphics to solidify the feeling and intent of the physics system.</p>
                <p>In my first prototype, I only used iconography. I made it look like one balloon when one
                    balloon was used, and made it look like many balloons when there was more. I was surprised
                    to see how effective the iconography ended up being. The players almost immediately knew
                    what each element was supposed to do, and they said that when the graphic elements were
                    added, it did clearly communicate what the element was supposed to do.</p>
                <p>In the second prototype, instead of using graphics that showed more balloons when more
                    balloons were used, I used colours on the balloons to indicate something similar. The colours
                    were changing as the lifting force got stronger. So, instead of many balloons, it was a stronger
                    balloon, and this was indicated by the balloon getting redder as it got stronger. I made the
                    prototype with the coloured balloons to evaluate a separate way of indicating the same thing,
                    because maybe I would be surprised, and it would work better than just the graphics. I was,
                    however, not surprised when this ended up being less effective than the iconography.</p>
                <p>The comment I got the most was that it was not clear what it was indicating, and the colour
                    palette change was jarring. So, in the prototype I submitted, I opted for just submitting the
                    first one with just the graphics, as the colours just did not land at all.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, I think it is possible for me to fake physics, or make my own physics system,
                    but it is something I would have to work on further. The system I built is not where it should
                    or can be and needs a lot more work. The basics are there, which is helpful, and I learned a lot
                    about how it is possible to go around set systems in Unity and go down your own path.
                    However, it was not as successful as I hoped it would be. I do not think it is a lost cause, and
                    with some work, I might be able to have a system that would mean I never have to use Unity
                    physics again, but for now, I do not have this magical system that I not only understand but
                    achieves the same look and feel that Unity physics gives.</p>
                <p>But I did learn, however, that art in games does not have to be all that complicated.
                    Sometimes simple iconography works and communicates the same thing that complex art
                    does. Using only icons could even make a game that is fun and interesting to look at. Now, I
                    do not think my art in this prototype is perfect. I think if there were a few animations when
                    the character walked, or floated, or fell, it would look even more alive. For what I set out to
                    do with the art in the prototype, however, I think it was successful, and I had fun making it.</p>
                <p>Further expansion on how I approached my prototyping as well as my findings can be found
                    below.</p>
