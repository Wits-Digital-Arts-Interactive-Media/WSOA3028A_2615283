            <strong>Concept:</strong>
            <p>A Day in the Life of a Student is a text-based game where the player plays through one
                day’s routine of a student. They will be faced with the extremely complicated decisions
                that occur in a normal student’s daily life. The player will have to make choices based
                on what they think they would do in the given situation, or what they think would be the
                best course of action, to get the best outcome for their day.</p>
            <strong>Genre:</strong>
            <p>This game can be identified by several genres, namely: Text-Based Adventure, Role
                Playing Game, and Slice-Of-Life.</p>
            <p>What I mean by Text-Based Adventure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The game will focus on the narrative aspect.</li>
                <li>The player will be given choices that they make to progress the story.</li>
                <li>These choices have certain outcomes and sometimes influence future choices.</li>
                <li>For the narrative structure, I was looking at the game Path of Adventure (2018), as it
                    had the structure I was trying to achieve.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What I mean by Role Playing Game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There will be a stats and dice system in this game.</li>
                <li>The systems I had in mind are mainly inspired by Dungeons & Dragons (Mearls &
                    Crawford, 2014) for its ability rolls and scores, as well as Monster Prom (2018),
                    where stats affect whether the decisions players make succeed or not.</li>
                <li>For this game, some choices will require the player to roll a die, which is then
                    modified by their stats, and then determines the success of the choice they made.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What do I mean by a Slice-Of-Life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As Ruth Ayres (2011) says in her blog post, “In a nutshell, a Slice of Life story is simply a
                    small sliver of your ordinary life.”</li>
                <li>This game is an exaggerated version of a small part of a student’s life.</li>
                <li>This will also be informed by the aesthetics of the game, which will look like a diary
                    entry.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>World:</strong>
            <p>This game will be set in a university setting, something akin to what the University of
                Witwatersrand or the University of Pretoria looks like, as these are the two universities I
                am familiar with. However, I did make the descriptions of the university rather vague, so
                that whoever plays it can relate with their own experiences as a student.</p>
            <strong>How does the player move through the encounters:</strong>
            <p>The player will be moving through the world and the encounters they have through the
                choices they make, and the outcome of each of these choices, good or bad. (For a map
                of the story, see Annexure B for the Story Tree).</p>
            <p>Each player will follow the same path through the world but will most likely have
                different experiences.</p>
            <strong>Intentions:</strong>
            <p>My intentions for this game started rather simple. I wanted to make a game in Twine to
                see how hard or easy it would be.</p>
            <p>But now, this has changed slightly. I still want to make a game in Twine to see how it will
                work out, but in making the game in Twine, I came across some interesting things I can
                do with the elements I chose to have in my game.</p>
            <p>I am specifically referring to what the intention of the game is, as well as how I can use
                certain elements in the game to create the illusion of control for the player.</p>
            <p>So, along with wanting to make a game in Twine, I would like to attempt to create an
                illusion of control in my game. This is inspired by how unpredictable life can be as a
                student, and sometimes in the smallest of ways. The way I am attempting to emulate
                this is through the dice rolls, the stats, and the effect the stats have on the results of the
                player’s rolls.</p>
            <p>The dice roll will simulate the unpredictability of life. Even when you make what you
                think is the “right” choice, it might not work out the way that you think it will.</p>
            <p>The final stats that the player receives at the end of the game result in a progress report
                that provides a piece of feedback on each of the stats. When doing well in a stat, the
                feedback will congratulate the player, but it will also comment on how they should not
                let this affect other aspects of their life. It is in reference to the work-life balance that so
                many of us struggle to uphold.</p>
