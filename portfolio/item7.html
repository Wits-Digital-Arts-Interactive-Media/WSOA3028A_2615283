                <strong>Reflection:</strong>
                <p><em>How did it feel to redraft this piece?</em></p>
                <p>I really enjoyed rewriting this piece. These two characters make me laugh, because they are
                    stepping on each other’s toes, and it makes the conflict so juicy. It was a little bit tough,
                    because there was so much that still felt weird before rewriting the piece, but it was kind of
                    hard to figure out what it is that feels weird about it.</p>
                <p>I think it has improved some in this draft, both have more actions that I feel show their
                    personalities more.</p>
                <p><em>What do you like most about your piece, why?</em></p>
                <p>The fact that Mason is still messing with the switch that got them into that mess. That is
                    hilarious to me. It is such a small part, but it shows Mason’s personality so well. And I feel as
                    if it is glaringly obvious Layla wants to smack him with the chisel, because he is annoying. I
                    love their relationship a lot, because there is a lot of tension, and I think that could create
                    some interesting stories, were I to continue using these two characters in my writing.</p>
                <p><em>What part of your piece needs the most improvement, why?</em></p>
                <p>I struggled with how to structure some parts of the story. There where Layla is ranting about
                    what an idiot Mason is, I really enjoy that part, but I am unsure if the structure is effective. I
                    am afraid that it might feel like it is too on top of each other, or that the fact that it is in two
                    separate paragraphs might be confusing. But when it is in one paragraph, it feels like too
                    much at once. So I am unsure how I should have approached that.</p>

                    <p>Layla lifted the chisel up and brought it down onto the rocks in front of her repeatedly. Her
                        lip raw where her teeth worked at it.</p>
                    <p>“Will you stop that? I’m trying to think.” Mason hissed as he paced.</p>
                    <p>Layla stopped and closed her eyes. <em>1-2-3-4-5-</em></p>
                    <p>“Well, at least I’m doing something! You- you are just- just sulking!” she spat. She spun
                        around, glaring at him. The small fire on the floor flickered.</p>
                    <p>Mason rolled his eyes. He turns his head away from the crude switch he was examining.</p>
                    <p>“I’m thinking not sulking,” he says, looking at his nails.</p>
                    <p>“<em>I’m thinking not sulking</em>,” Layla mocked under her breath. She hit at the wall again.</p>
                    <p>“We are not getting through there. Get that through your thick skull,” his voice loud. “You
                        hitting at it is not helping.”</p>
                    <p>Layla frowned, her shoulders hunching. Her hands clenched around the chisel as she looked
                        up at him.</p>
                    <p>“We are in here because of you, asshole!” She points the chisel at him. “You had to come in
                        here and fuck around! We were supposed to come in here, get the artifact and leave. But no!”
                        She throws her hands in the air.</p>
                    <p>“I’m Mason, and I f**k with switches in old tombs,” Layla continues. Mason guiltily lowers
                        his hand from where he was flicking at the switch again. “I do not want to die here because
                        you are an idiot!”</p>
                    <p>Layla walks over and shoves the chisel into his hands. Mason looked at her with wide eyes.</p>
