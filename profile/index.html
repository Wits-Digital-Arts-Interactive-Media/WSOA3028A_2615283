            I am an aspiring Game Designer and Writer, currently studing for a BA in Digital Arts at the University of the Witwatersrand. 
            I enjoy reading in my free time, my favourite genres being fantasy and sci-fi. I love playing video games whenever I 
            can. I have been making my way through my library of games I have not had time to play. I also enjoy any form of arts and 
            crafts, ranging from crocheting to drawing. I can spend a lot of my time listening to true crime podcasts, or talking someone's ear
            off about an odd piece of history I recently learned about.

        <h2>Some of my Inspirations:</h2>
        <details>
        <summary id="inspiration">Concerned Ape</summary>
        <p>Yes, he created one of the most popular games all on his own, which I find massively impressive. But this isn't really why I find him to be inspirational.</p>
        <p>I do find the game inspirational, partly because the type of game Stardew Valley is, is my favourite genre. I own so many games like that, half of which I haven't even come close to finishing. But the main reason I find the game inspirational is because of how good it is. It is content rich without being overwhelming. The storytelling is amazing. The UI is extremely intuitive. And it is a game that can be played by anyone. It is just overall, objectively a good game.</p>
        <p>The reason I find Eric Barone to be so inspirational, is because of his outlook on life and the work that he does. Stardew Vally is his game. But he made it and continued to work on it with his players in mind. He is open to constructive critisism, and listens to his players. Hence the amount of things he has added to the game after player modded it into the game.</p>
        <p>He is a humble guy who made a great and affordable game, and is also making anoter game that I cannot wait for. I have no problem supporting his journey in game making, and I will continue to find inspiration in his work and in who he is as a Game Developer and person.</p>

        <summary id="inspiration">Critical Role</summary>
        <p>Critical Role is a group of voice actors who play Dungeons and Dragons on a regular basis, films it and posts it online. These people are story tellers at heart, and as an aspiring Game Designer and Writer, I find them to be very inspirational.</p>
        <p>From the view of a writer, it might be obvioud why I find this group to be inspirational. They have created stories I can only dream of creating. Stories that are engaging, exciting and fun to listen to and emerge myself in. There is something to be learned in how they tell their stories for a writer, but also for a Game Designer. (Most) Games tell stories, just in a different medium to pen and paper or a typed up document. When I tell stories in my games, I want to tell a good one. And thus, I need to atleast sort of know how to write and tell one.</p>
        <p>This group creaes magic through their stories, and it is something I would like to do in my my writing and in any game I will be involved in.</p>

        <details>
        <summary id="inspiration">My Education</summary>
        <p>Specifically my highschool education. I try to find inspiration in this, because I hated it. I did relatively well, but the experience was sub par. However, I have a passion for bringing games and game design into the educational sphere. I have realised with the degree I am doing now, there are better ways to teach teenagers, and I feel the way it is done traditionally doesn't work for most kids.</p>
        <p>I have learned more in the span of two and a half years of making physical things than I have in highschool writing tests. Well, at least it feels like I have. The reason I say this, is because the only things I retained from school was math skills, because we had to repeatedly practice it, and technical drawing skills because I had to physically do it to learn. I have not retained any useful accounting or science skills outside a few interesting facts. I am not even going to mention my language skills... they suck.</p>
        <p>But I think this is something that can be remedied. We live in a time where tecnology is very developed. We can bring that into the classroom and find new ways to teach kids effectively, and I truly believe this can be done through something like games. Thus, I take my experience in the educational sphere as inspiration to try and find ways we can change it and possibly improve it.</p>
